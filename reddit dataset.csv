As AI writing tools like Chat GPT become more prevalent, it raises the question of whether traditional forms of written communication are on the verge of extinction. With the ability to generate entire documents with a single click, will the skills of crafting a well-written story and developing critical thinking be lost? At The 10 Story Pen, we are committed to exploring these questions and finding ways to incorporate the benefits of AI while still preserving the value of traditional writing. Is 2023 the year we say goodbye to writing as we know it? Is it going the way of the horse &amp; buggy with the rise of AI. Are we headed towards a future where pressing the enter button is all it takes to become your doctorâ€“or your dentist?

I want to keep learning and growing professionally so I've been tempted to start a Master's Degree and while I was researching some good programs in different schools I started reading about Professional Certificates. I found out that a Master's degree can get really broad and you can only get an enfasis using your electives rather than being 100% focused on a specific topic like certificates. Machine Learning and AI are super facinatign technologies and there are some schools ofering certificates that look very attractive to me. Specifically [MIT](https://professional.mit.edu/certificate-programs), [eCornell](https://ecornell.cornell.edu/certificates/technology/), [Harvard](https://extension.harvard.edu/academics/?live_global%5BrefinementList%5D%5Blevels%5D%5B0%5D=Graduate%20Certificate) are some of the ones that looks very good. I know that to get a Master's the application process to any of those schools and prices get astronomically high so I looked at programs like [ASU's Master's CS Degree](https://asuonline.asu.edu/online-degree-programs/graduate/computer-science-mcs/) and others. The question is, specially for developers and professionals out there. What would be better ? IF you have done both or either, how much does it help you professionally to get either one of the previous options. Should I get a certificate from a top School like MIT to Harvard or a MS Degree from another school like ASU, etc. Which option would help me advance my carrier further ? Considering costs and the time it takes to complete either, what is the better option ? Do those certificates look good on a resume or people would value more a MS Degree?  


Any helpful insight on this is highly appreciated."

I am still a PhD student (and also not a native English speaker), and sometimes I waste a lot of time in a paragraph re-reading my sentences which gets me thinking, â€œokay this is good, but there is definitely a better way to make this idea clearer for the readerâ€.
With chatGPT, though, it does that instantly, usually in a brilliant way.
In my view, I donâ€™t see any ethical problem with that (because these sentences were my ideas and thoughts, chatGPT only re-worded them to make it clear). Some people argue that when using a language model AI to write manuscripts, I should acknowledge it.
I would say that many researchers were already using some sort of â€œAIâ€ to write (like myself with Grammarly) and Iâ€™ve never seen anyone acknowledge grammaly in any paper (or at least disclose it to the reviewers). Sure, chatGPT is definitly more sophisticates at rewording sentences, but it still only modifying the words and vocabulary, like how grammarly does.
I am opposed, however, to ask chatGPT to formulate and create its sentences with the chatâ€™s own ideas to add to a manuscript (this is where I would draw a line).
What are your ethicals thoughts on the matter? Would you say asking chatGPT to re-word sentences for better clarity is an ethical concern for publications? I am curious to see where the academic community draws a line"

My college career is coming to an end and I wrapped my NG job hunt during these crazy times and I wanted to share my experience.

**applications**: 119, used [this](https://github.com/coderQuad/New-Grad-Positions-2023) Github repo to find all my jobs.

**prep**: blind 75, neetcode, and company specific questions w/ lc premium

**background**: cs undergrad @ purdue, 3 internships (2x JPMC, 1x Textron), teaching assistant, 3.8 GPA

I added a video [here](https://youtu.be/tz-3Ho29yN8) for those that don't want to read (mods lmk if this isn't allowed and I'll remove it).

**applied/ghost (51/119):**

Nothing much to talk about other than rip me thinking I had a chance to pass the resume screen for some of these companies. Some of the notable companies that I havenâ€™t heard back from are Databricks, Google, Apple, Datadog, Netflix, Uber, Twitter (ty for ghosting me Elon in hindsight), Oracle, and PayPal.

**in progress (6/119):**

I probably got ghosted by all of these companies as well tbh

* Morgan Stanley havenâ€™t reached out after their HireVue
* submitted a perfect OA for Blackrock &amp; matched with them on Ripplematch
* did mediocre on TikTokâ€™s OA, so not surprised

**rejected (58/119):**

First, I declined interviews for 11 companies (IMC, Vanguard, Walmart, Gap, Hive AI, etc). This was because i wasnâ€™t fond of the interview style (ehmm IMC's one way interview) or i didnâ€™t want to commit my time for on-sites.

Another 11 companies rejected me because their headcounts were filled for the recruiting season (C1, Figma, Pinterest, Visa, Roblox, etc). I applied as quickly as i can for these companies, so I guess my resume wasnâ€™t strong enough to get picked

Next, I got rejected from 13 companies after at least one round of interviews/OAs. I had an 813 codesignal score, but it wasn't enough for companies like Circle and ZipRecruiter. I submitted a perfect OA for Goldman Sachs and had a recruiter reach out to me, so I donâ€™t know what went wrong there. SpaceXâ€™s assessment was only offered Python or C++ and I use Java for my interviews, so that didnâ€™t turn out well. For Palantir, DraftKings, FactSet, etc, I submitted terrible OAs, so I wasn't surprised getting rejected. Finally, I got rejected after my final round of Mathworks. I got asked a system design question, and didnâ€™t prepare for that, so again, wasnâ€™t surprised getting rejected.

Finally, i got rejected from 23 companies after the resume screen (Microsoft, Adobe, Scale AI, Zoom, Twilio, Doordash, Lucid, Niantic, etc)

**offers (4/119):**

Finally, the part most of you guys probably were interested in.

**JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co.**
* First, I was able to get a return offer from my internship at JPMC. A pro with banks is that for the most part they are pretty recession proof. The compensation package was 110k base, 20k sign-on, and 10k performance. 140k 1st yr and 120k reoccurring

**StubHub**
* Their process was a behavioral phone round, a technical interview, and a final demo presentation. Iâ€™d say the technical interview was trivial given that you know your data structures. The final was like me being on Shark Tank, so it definitely was a bit weird, as I was expecting a technical interview. After negotiating with StubHub, I was able to get an offer of $170k base, $320k RSUs split evenly across 4 years, and a 10k sign-on. The tc was 260k for the first year, and 250k reoccurring. Before you guys go crazy, the TC is a bit misleading, as StubHub is still a private company, so till then, the stock is paper money. Moreover, with the current state of the economy, i personally donâ€™t think they will IPO any time soon.

**General Motors**
* The process was 2 rounds, a hirevue and a final round that only consisted of behavioral questions. Their compensation package was Base: $87k Bonus: 10% of base Sign-on: $5k TC: $100.7k (1st year), $95.7k (reoccurring). So, if you guys donâ€™t like technical interviews, make sure to apply to general motors. Their process also took around 3 weeks.

**Bloomberg (accepted)**
* Their process was a technical phone interview, a virtual onsite consisting of 2 technicals and 1 behavioral round. For me, solving Bloomberg tagged questions on leetcode was enough prep for me. After negotiating, I was able to get an offer of $155k base, 30k bonus, and 10k relocation bonus. So, the tc was 195k first year, then 185k reoccurring. Their process took around 2 months, and this was apparently due to a lot of people applying.

**final thoughts:**

* Definitely apply as fast as you can, as much as you can. I hate to say it, but at the end of the day itâ€™s a numbers game
* [Join](https://discord.com/invite/cscareers) cscareers.devâ€™s discord server so that you can connect with other new grads. They definitely helped me secure valuable information.
* Leetcode. I think getting lc premium for the duration of your job search is worth it bc it allows access to see specific companyâ€™s questions. Think of it as an investment to yourself and itâ€™ll pay off when you get an offer.

lmk if you guys have any questions, and I'll try to answer as many as I can!"

The draft LOR:

Dear Admissions Committee,
I am writing this letter of recommendation for Chirantan Ganguly, a student of BTech. in ECE at University of Calcutta (Institute of Radio Physics and Electronics), for the [University Name]'s Masters program in Artificial Intelligence. As his research supervisor for over a year, I have had the pleasure of working closely with Chirantan and I can confidently say that he is an exceptional student with exceptional potential.

Chirantan joined Centre for Development of Advanced Computing (CDAC), Pune as a research intern under my supervision during his second year of studies. Despite having limited knowledge in Machine Learning algorithms, he demonstrated remarkable persistence and dedication to learning. He read a vast amount of quality research articles, conducted a thorough survey of the latest research articles exploring the use of ML in tackling COVID-19 and its effect on mental and physical health, and was even able to publish review chapters in peer-reviewed and Scopus-indexed books in just four months.

In addition, Chirantan also worked on a major project with my team in CDAC Pune and Chennai, utilizing ML techniques for the localization of mobile nodes in indoor settings. This project was taken up by CDAC as part of an annual hackathon organized by the International Telecommunication Union (ITU) called ML in 5G Challenge. Chirantan's ingenuity in solving the problem and exceptional presentation skills earned him recognition and helped our team attain the 2nd global rank. Our team was awarded a cash prize and a certificate of commendation by the problem setters (TTC Japan). He even went on to document the steps we took, resulting in a journal publication.

After his engagement with CDAC, Chirantan went on to work as an intern at the Scientific Analysis Group of DRDO. He was also selected for the Summer Research Fellowship Program (SRFP), awarded by INSA, NASI, and IASc, to conduct research at IIT Delhi for two months. Throughout all these engagements, Chirantan has consistently maintained his top ranking in his class and exceptional grades. He also has exhibited exceptional leadership skills being his class representative and the head of his Universityâ€™s coding club.

In conclusion, I cannot recommend Chirantan highly enough for the [University Name]'s Masters program in Artificial Intelligence. His dedication, hard work, eagerness to learn, and level headed problem solving skills combined with his exceptional performance and potential, make him an ideal candidate for the program. I am confident that his participation in this esteemed program and global exposure will help him grow into a renowned AI researcher, a career he has always aspired to pursue.

Thank you for considering Chirantan for this opportunity.

Sincerely,
[Your Name]"

For some context; I am writing a paper on the pros and cons of a multipolar world. I asked for some papers on the subject and here's how it went. It gave me a list and I tried further narrowing the results with the following question.

\&gt;Me:  Which of the mentioned papers addresses the implications in regards to global stability and security? 

\&gt;AI:  John Mearsheimer's paper ""The Future of Multipolarity"" addresses the implications of a multipolar world in regards to global stability and security. In this paper, Mearsheimer argues that a multipolar world would be more stable than a unipolar world dominated by a single superpower, but less stable than a bipolar world with two dominant powers. Mearsheimer explains that in a multipolar world, multiple great powers are likely to compete with each other, which could lead to conflict. However, he also notes that the presence of multiple great powers can help to balance power and prevent any one power from becoming too dominant. As a result, Mearsheimer concludes that a multipolar world would be more stable than a unipolar world, but less stable than a bipolar world. 

Now, I have searched everywhere on the internet and I have not found the mentioned paper. Could it be that it changed under a different name or the paper might just not exist? Could this dollar-tree AI be tripping?

I'm pretty conflicted about what to do, I'm already in a pretty good situation where I like the research I do and I'm pumping out papers quickly since I'm working more so on the application side of AI. At the same time, it's really hard to ignore the prospect of going to a top 5 school where I could do truly cutting-edge research.

I do admit there is this peer pressure of having to find a job first to gain some work experience before thinking of doing a PhD, but I am keen to continue research in the media field - especially with the issues surrounding social media, AI, etc. 

I would also like to teach at universities as a lecturer in the long-term run. I've noticed how I have fun explaining media theories to my friends and simplifying the concepts - allowing me to open this idea of ""what if I try teaching?"". 

To the kind, experienced people in Reddit, should I continue for a PhD in Media Studies? If yes, how do I get started? Do I approach my university of choice with a research proposal for my PhD research? Do I start looking at my Masters Thesis and see what ways I can compress them into a journal article for publication? Is it necessary for PhD applicants to already have a publication of their own (I don't have any)? Is it possible to start small teaching jobs whilst doing a PhD - say part-time for example?

That friend got an academic job back in his home country (China), and I guess academics there use an English editing service for a fee before submitting papers.

And they did. I helped with three papers over the course of 2 years averaging 500$ a piece.

First off, is there anything unethical about what I did in the first place?

The evidence says ""No.""",AskAcademia,1676924476,26,26,0,0.77,0,0,0,47,"I just started the alternate route program at my school district, and am currently debating whether I should get my Master's, since I want to teach English/the humanities at the high school level as a stepping stone to being a college professor. My mentor, a former teacher of mine, and other people I've talked to have advised me to get my certification in Education and then the subject area Master's as soon as possible, since I will accumulate benefits and pay over the long run and thank my younger self. 

The issue is that I have heard some very negative things about humanities graduate school programs, obviously because of the awful job market right now and how many people get into debt by borrowing insane amounts in student loans. I already have debt from my undergrad degree, and what really angers me is that grad schools in my situation don't offer any fellowships I can apply to so I can cover the cost of my education, leaving me with two options: hunting for scholarships, and/or paying for grad school out of pocket. I'm not taking out another penny in loans, and that is a promise I made to myself. 

The other thing that bothers me is how poorly paid so many adjunct professors seem to be, and how becoming tenured is essentially a crapshoot unless you really distinguish yourself or get lucky. The professors from my own alma mater recently went on strike because the university wasn't paying them enough to cover their living expenses, and didn't give them any health insurance. The university caved in eventually and gave the professors and union reps a massive raise + benefits, but this highlights a huge problem in academia that is only getting worse these days: that is, the adjunctification, or gigification, or McDonaldization of the academic sphere, as more and more colleges turn into for-profit corporate mills designed to exploit students, teachers, and everyone for the benefit of a few bankrolling college elites (Provosts, Presidents, etc). 

There's also the issue of the humanities becoming less and less viable as a career path because of job scarcity, combined with the high cost of living, and the looming threat of AI. STEM/Business seems to be the future and the data demonstrates this worrying trend. Already many colleges have started to cut non-useful academic programs in the arts because the corporate elites running education to the ground have decided the liberal arts are meaningless since they don't produce immediate profits or economic value for society, and are therefore wasteful under capitalism. It's all part of the push to see college increasingly as a ROI, students as customers or clients, etc, and it's sickening to see. 

I'm not exactly sure what to do at this point, as an art school grad turned teacher who was initially motivated by passion rather than money regarding careers, but am starting to more rationally think that I should cut my losses and aim for the $$$ for the sake of financial stability. Education is facing a crisis of unprecedented proportions and I'm scared for how the future may turn out."

First post here. I'm working with an undergraduate volunteer on a research project. I gave them the task of doing a lit review on a topic-- finding and reviewing some relevant papers and writing up a coherent and cohesive summary of what they found. They sent me something that I thought was decent (but incomplete), certainly compared to my expectations for the amount of energy the student would put in. In conversation, AI search machine was mentioned and I got the sense that student used this for the lit review, which also explained why no additional papers were added to the lit review than the ones I sent them. Since I hadn't even know about this possibility, on the fly I mentioned that even though it seems helpful, it may be questionable ethically, but, more importantly, it does not promote the normal learning that happens when you read a bunch of papers, consider all the literature included, and write your own summary. Student said I have a point. Now I'm a little conflicted because the lit review was going to be used for a manuscript I'm working on (never verbatim, but hopefully a good basis to build upon), and I told the student that if they participate in the writing via the lit review, they will be included as a co-author. However, now I'm questioning if what they've done so far qualifies, if it's AI that spit it out. (That also explains why the lit review wasn't supper cohesive and mostly included summaries of the individual papers.) There are more parts to this assignment, so going forward I can give the student the opportunity to do things differently. 

Any thoughts on this? Thanks. 

P.S. I had to choose a flair; don't know if it's quite ""professional misconduct in research,"" but it seemed to be the closest option."

Long story short, I recently had the opportunity to learn about a new methodology in my field that few other people know how to use. I now have a bunch of ideas for how to apply this methodology to problems I've worked on previously. My secondary advisor is pretty excited about this new methodology, and the problems to which I plan to apply it.

Unfortunately, my primary advisor is less enthused about my new direction. In his defense, it is a bit outside of his wheelhouse, though it's well within the scope of my overall project. 

However, his response to my new interests has caused me a lot of concern. For one, he insists that I apply my methodology to a specific domain because it interests him more. This struck me as odd: I'd happily change my direction if he had a scientific critique of it, but I don't particularly want to change my project based on his personal interests. Moreover, my experience with the methodology leads me to believe that it's a poor fit for his domain of interest.

So I suggested, as a compromise, that I pursue not only my project, but also a project that he would be happier supervising. To my surprise, he stated that he would ""choose to count only projects he supervised towards my thesis,"" even if my other project's content fit well with the rest of the thesis. It seemed like a big red flag to me that he would both refuse to supervise work that he found too far from his interests, and refuse to count work that he doesn't directly supervise toward my thesis. 

What should I do? I think that part of this problem comes from the fact that my advisor is very junior, and wants to collaborate very closely with me, his first student. In contrast, I find myself less interested in his research directions and close collaboration with him, and would probably be better matched with a more senior advisor who might take a more hands-off approach.

What is a reasonable course of action here? Is my advisor's behavior normal? For reference, I wasn't hired to work on any specific project, and thought I would have a lot of research freedom."

My institution (University of Washington) is quite competitive for the former but not so much for the latter. I have been very involved in computer science research and have been doing research since my first quarter in a hot field (AI), so I am certain that if I continued in that direction I would be able to secure a spot in a competitive CS PhD program.

The trouble is that my heart is just tired of doing CS. I love talking about the ideas, but in terms of actually conducting the research, I just can't do it. I almost had a breakdown submitting my last paper, and somehow I have signed myself up to lead another research project. I also do not want to go into industry; I really did not like my time at an internship I did last summer. It took me here to really realize that doing CS work is just not for me.

On the other hand, I'm always excited to do philosophy, and after a lot of reflection in these past few months, I feel like I would want to pursue a philosophy PhD and do philosophy academically. I've done well (4.0s) in all my philosophy classes, read philosophy books outside of class for fun, and have good relationships with professors (one whom I am continuing independent study with). I'm a pretty lonely and materially unambitious person, so facts like difficulties with romantic relationships, not having kids, not being financially stable, etc. don't deter me. I am the type of person to consume myself in the work I do and I feel like my dream work is philosophy. My dream, if you will indulge me, would be to make my academic career working on a continental approach to the philosophy of AI (specifically: working out an ontology, phenomenology, and politics of information in deep learning models).

Here are some more points for consideration:

* The reason I want to pursue a philosophy PhD is because I feel that even though CS is getting better at entertaining non-technical perspectives (e.g. in HCI or social computing), philosophy isn't really seriously considered. What I want to do is to work on the philosophy of AI, not AI with a philosophical bent (which often ends up subjugating and appropriating philosophy for CS purposes). But I'm curious if my view is false or incomplete.
* My institution isn't ranked very highly for philosophy, even though I've enjoyed the classes. But it's also a very analytic department and there are no faculty who work in the philosophy of AI (closest person is one person in philosophy of mind). Moreover, philosophy of AI is a very specific and new field and the approaches are basically all analytic (I don't think I'm interested in philosophy of mind approaches -- I think they're done in a vacuum and old). This is all to say that my dream of working in continental approaches to the philosophy of AI is highly improbable.
* Despite this, I think that at least philosophy of AI seems to be an area of philosophy which maybe has more funding and attention due to recent events and trends than others, so maybe there is some hope there. I'm sort of hanging on to this idea.
* Even though my department is analytic, I've done a lot of my own independent reading in continental philosophy and taken classes with continental philosophy content (English, Comparative History of Ideas, Comparative Literature, etc. -- Marxism, phenomenology, Derrida, etc.). So I feel like I have enough of a grasp of continental philosophy to know that I want to pursue it. 
* My parents of course want me to go to CS industry and are very unhappy about a philosophy PhD. My connection with them isn't too strong and ultimately if I think doing a philosophy PhD is the right choice I will do it. But in an ideal world I'd like them to support me, and to be able to support them if needed when they get older.

I know that, given the material conditions, pursuing a philosophy PhD over a CS PhD is pretty stupid. But I really just do not want to pursue CS/deep learning rigorously beyond undergrad; I would love to philosophize about it from the outside (where I think it needs to be). What I would love for people to comment on is if I need a reality check, if my goals are possible, and if they are, what steps I can do to maximize my possibility of actualizing it in the remaining two years of my undergrad."

I am not sure how much he did use chatgpt in the paper, I put his text into detector it says it is unclear. I put an acknowledgement in the paper saying we used chatgpt and he removed it, saying people might think we used the GPT for the whole paper and we already edited the output so we are not directly using chatgpt. 
But during the same meeting he is telling me how chatgpt could be bad for students, he said his student is suspicious on the quizzes and might cheated using GPT. 

I also used chatgpt a little bit in the paper, one time is just for fun I copy and data into chatgpt and he gave the conclusion. Most of them are garbage but one point is useful so I used the idea. (No copy from GPT tho) the second time is that I asked him what could be questions asked about this paper. It gave me like 20ish, one of them is opsomething I have never thought about.So I added that to my paper.

Is this academia misconduct? And is what my supervisor told me to do misconduct? How should I talk with him? He thinks this is just like using word auto complete.

I'm a current Master's student in Neuroscience doing a fellowship for my thesis in computational neuroscience/neuroimaging. I have little to no math/physics background, and only made it through a few CS classes in undergrad. My background is almost entirely in neurobiology &amp; genetics, with a bit of theoretical stuff thrown in along the way. I'd like to continue down a path focusing on computational neuro/cogsci, but I feel super overwhelmed by continuing straight from a biology-focused bachelor's and master's into a world where somewhere along the way, I was supposed to be taught math.

I know that I \*can\* self-study, but this is super difficult to do on top of my current work &amp; everything. So, I'm wondering if I should go for another MSc in something like Comp Neuro or Cognitive Science, or go all the way back to a Bachelor's to do CS/Math/Physics.

At this point, I'm pretty fucked by loans from American &amp; (non-European) Dutch education, so I'm considering to go to a university somewhere that's cheap (e.g. Germany). This post is most likely just serving to quell some of my anxieties, but I'm very much a ""do things the right way"" person on a ""stumbling around academia"" path and it's not so fun!

I really love the work that I'm doing now, and I would really like to keep doing it. Plus, the job security of computational work is great (as you can move pretty easily into data science/ML/AI, and all of those are appealing to me.)

I definitely have the option of going straight to PhD, especially given the lab that I'm in currently, but that prospect is becoming more and more anxiety-inducing for me. At the same time, I've already made it into this research community and don't really want to leave it for more studies."

I don't really have many job opportunities nearby so I can't move, I have to 'hack' the system or learn to excel.

Around 600 dollars per year is given by the college to cover conference/publishing costs. I have published in 3 journals so far. I paid out of my pocket for one. Springer-Uni open access agreement covered for the other two.

I wasn't particularly interested in research and I am not very good at it in my opinion. But I want to get better. My current research area is medical image processing. I am also looking at AI, NLP, DL. But I see that in these fields, publishing in Q1 Q2 journals requires significant hours of work. We are very overworked as it is, loaded with admin tasks and classes and labs. I have a baby at home which I want to spend time with after college hours, don't really want to take work hoe.

I see colleagues in chemistry churning out 5 to 10 papers easily and profs meeting 50+ for 2023. Does it depend on the field, if yes, can I pivot at this point slowly so I can make my publishing life easier?

I know if I have solid math and rigorous research skills, it is a piece of cake, but how do I continue publishing as I improve my skills?

How do I find collaborators aboard at this point? Meeting at conferences yes, but I have a 600 dollar limit which is ridiculosly low IMO. I am not really keen on 'investing' my money here."

Could this sub please help me decide which would be the better option of the two? I am considering all aspects such as job/research opportunities, location, peers, fees, curriculum etc.

I wish to work as a machine learning engineer/research engineer in the future. Iâ€™m not sure whether I would want to pursue a PhD in the future but itâ€™s something that Iâ€™ll definitely consider. Please let me know your valuable insights that can help me evaluate the best offer for my career.

Personally, I feel NTU Singapore would be a better fit for me despite the 5 times higher tuition fees than KU Leuven. The reason being that NTU is a top university for Artificial Intelligence and Singapore seems to have reasonable job opportunities in my area of interest. I like the curriculum as well and itâ€™s closer to India. Iâ€™ll have to work part-time as TA/RA to cover my expenses at Singapore. NTU is not as diverse as almost all students are from China, Singapore, India, Malaysia, Indonesia and Thailand.

KU Leuven on the other hand is a beautiful college at a great location and highly reputed as well. Iâ€™ve heard that many students are enrolled in the MSc Artificial Intelligence program. While the curriculum is nice, it may not go in-depth. However, since I wonâ€™t have to do part-time work, Iâ€™ll be able to focus more on self-study along with the college curriculum. It wonâ€™t eat all my savings and Iâ€™ll be able to work in Europe which is quite a nice place.

PS: I am currently a Software Engineer at Microsoft (2 YOE) and wish to switch to ML Engineer/Data Science roles somewhere outside India for sometime. I have not done research work in the past and want to work after masters but I would like to dip my toes into research during my masters. Also, Iâ€™m awaiting a response from KTH MSc ML, University of Amsterdam MSc AI and NUS Singapore MComp (AI Specialisation). If I get offers from these programmes as well, what should I choose?"

Since the beginning of the semester, I couldn't get myself to like the program. I love the major, but I can't see myself spending 4 more years to get a B.E, and the courses aren't directly useful to what I want to work on in the future.

I was considering transferring to physics, because I'm good at it, all the content is useful to me, but I lose that engineer title, and I hear physics is much more theoretical and unless I have at least a M.S and some serious practical experience in engineering, it's much harder to get a job building high-tech stuff in industry abroad (say U.S). It's like going for a major that is academic and theoretical, and then trying to do engineering with it. 

I have an absurd amount of experience in CS with a focus on AI, as I developed an interest towards the  field about a decade ago. Apart from what I'm working on currently on AI and Fintech, I see myself in the future working on robotics, humanoids, drones, model rockets, and these kinds of advanced technologies. I'm dedicated, I'm really good at what I do, and yet I have no idea what I should major in.

I've talked with around 5 advisors now and nobody could help me. They're all telling me that I'm trying to decide my major based on what I want to do in the future, and that I should just major in what I like and let the journey take me along, but I can absolutely not do that.

First time browser of your subreddit. To preface, I'm working in video production and we've encountered a challenge that I think you guys could help with, or at least maybe point me in the right direction. I hope it's okay to ask for your advice here!

To summarise, we have a long term corporate client with whom we've shot and collected a large amount of interview footage from different people. Let's say 50 interviews. Each interview covers a number of topics which we are using time and time again for various videos. We have each interview transcribed in its own Google Docs file.

We're currently hitting a point where searching for quotes on topics across all the interviews is getting quite time consuming. 

I'm wondering if there is any software that is used in your field which enables the ingestion of all the documents, tagging of certain quotes, and maybe even an AI feature which could pull specific untagged quotes. 

We're anticipating this collection of interviews to grow significantly going forward so would ideally like to get ahead of the headache now. 

If you have any ideas even for search terms I'd be grateful as it's quite tricky to find something blind like this. 

Thanks in advance!"

The best papers that Iâ€™ve read in AI are incredibly simple and straightforward, and just really high quality that you genuinely enjoy reading them. And those papers are usually what push the industry forward, like Attention is all you need.

Yet, and Iâ€™m starting to notice this as Iâ€™m reading papers done by my advisors, a lot of papers are just really bad. They use complicated sentences to explain simple concepts, they riddle the papers with words you donâ€™t know the meaning of, they write entire paragraphs to explain things that could be explained in one sentence, and many times they create an entirely new framework using some highly advanced and complicated concepts (basically over-engineering their work), to achieve some bare profits over the SOTA frameworks.

The best thing is, all of these never see the light of day in industry, as real-world systems are complicated enough and have many constraints, and no one is willing to implement these papers when a much simpler model exists, even if a little worse in results.

I just want to know why people like to show off. I just read a paper so complicated, and summarized it into literally two simple equations. People who write papers are already academically accomplished, what do they have to prove?

I apologize for the rant. I just hate how real world systems are usually very straightforward, yet there are people who try to glorify them and make them seem like magic that came out of their ass after they memorized half the english language, engineered an entirely new field, wrote a paper that needs its own dictionary to understand, just to achieve 2% gain over the standard."

Hello,

I currently attend online courses, as they are more amenable to my time. Today I entered the class, and due to the ChatGPT scare, the professor said to no longer use even Grammarly.

I am not saying I have not used AI on schoolwork; after performing the research, submitting it, and having it graded (except for Grammarly,.). I do use (ChatGPT)on it afterward to expand or further explore ideas. Later, the prof implied that using Grammarly could result in forwarding it to the dean, but I still plan on using it.

To further expand...before I started using Grammarly...I still achieved the same grades. It immensely helps with my editing of errors on a final product. Am I too upset about this?"

For starters we'll talk about highschool first, AP student (6 or 7 AP tests average above 3.75 on them) 1390 SAT, 31 ACT, no class rank because I essentially finished my senior year online through a program which allowed me to graduate early(not in the idealistic way but because I had undergone some unrelated problems outside of school). Athlete as well, but nothing significant. 

Then my first attempt at college, took a semester at UCCS as a declared double major in physics and philosophy and subsequently flunked essentially straight F's, though I did receive a sympathy C- in my first year honors course. Which yes I was in the honors program, and I even found my way into the student government as a senator. After this semester I took the spring off, moved to Denver and went to CUD because they were same family of university I was able to transfer despite my gpa, for a summer semester which was also covid summer. If I recall correctly I wound up with a 3.5 gpa that semester. 

Now the reason why I think I even have a chance despite the less than ideal start; after the summer I subsequently checked myself into a rehab, and will soon be celebrating two years sober. Once back in the real world back home ish in Austin one of the first things I did was register for ACC. Since doing so I have maintained a 4.0 whilst double majoring in physics and economics. I am a member of the honors program, and a few other honors societies, I will graduate an honors scholar. I have received the chancellors honor's award for graduating with perfect GPA, ""the highest academic award given at acc."" I have also worked the entire time, at some nicely named companies, Tesla, GoogleFiber, and will intern at Dell this coming summer. I have a decent amount of volunteer hours at habitat for humanity. Overall I'd say my resume is decent and I can write some damn good essay's though I don't know how much that matters now that I'm competing with ai. 

That being said I applied to UT Austin for transfer and feel really good about my chances of getting in. But given my circumstances I can't help but feel like had I not fucked off as a kid I would be at one of the big name privates or Ivy leagues. So I kinda wish I had put more effort into building a perfect application for Columbia or University of Chicago, where I may have had a chance with the right application. Instead I'm a bit bummed out that I was so meticulous and put so much energy into my UT application, mainly as a result of all the teachers and advisors constantly reminding the students here about how ""competetive"" it is, (fair warning I know what I'm about to say is largely egotistical) but it's honestly probably not that competitive for me I mean had I just gone to school my senior year of hs I would have graduated top7% of my class and would have been automatically admitted to UT. And so for the majority of kids whom find themselves at acc expecting to transfer to UT it's difficult and competitive bc they didn't have the ""juice"" to get there right off the bat. And same goes for me but I can't help but think that I had plenty of juice, so much so I split it and made a big ole mess lmao. 

So here I am, graduating with a couple associates degrees in less than a month, having only applied to UT, and with most if not all fall transfer applications for the big names closed. Wondering what is my best plan of action. Spoiler alert: it's probably just go to UT because it's in state and I can semi afford it. But maybe it's just keep taking classes at ACC and go super hard on extracurriculars to build the perfect spring application to Columbia GS(this program really makes me think I have a chance, and I'd love to starve in a NYC) 

Or maybe I transfer to UT for a semester to build that perfect app to then transfer to big name.

Overall looking for opinions on what to do and what my chances for the possible options are. Or advice from community college and ivy league students alike. Do I even want to put myself through the ivy league stress?? Idk just wanted to outsource some ideas. 

THANK Y'ALL! 

tldr: is it possible to transfer from a CC to an ivy league?"

In these twoish years I've read probably 25% of the content they've sent me (*Science* magazine mostly), participated in one section meeting, and went to a few of the online colloquium events (or whatever they're called). I was part of the Industrial Applications section because my field was software engineering and nothing else seemed to fit.

I never really felt like I was benefitting much from my membership. I tried several times to get involved in different initiatives but no one ever responded to my attempts to connect. I assumed this was because my background wasn't the right fit (who wants a software engineer in the sciences, especially one with just a master's?). This was pretty disappointing because I do care a lot about advocating for science, especially as my own social and familial circles are a little wary of advancements in science and technology.

I'm a PhD student now and although my major is computer science, my research is in the area of computational chemistry, biology, and biophysics, with a little machine learning thrown in. I feel this at least aligns my background more closely to what a typical AAAS member's background might look like.

My membership is currently up for renewal and although I appreciate and identify with the stated mission of AAAS, I am not convinced that the association wants anything from me other than my 99 dollars. Since my previous attempts to get involved were met with indifference, I am unsure if subsequent attempts will be any different. I'm currently active in my state's IEEE section and serve as one of the chairs in my section; this has given me good opportunities to get involved in the local technology scene, and I really like doing that, but the IEEE mission isn't quite the same as AAAS's.

So, to make a long question short, as a PhD student--specifically, a computer science one--is membership in the AAAS worth it?

I studied Cognitive Science M. Sc. with a focus on deep learning, especially bio-inspired algorithms such as Spiking Neural Networks. I generally like programming and machine learning tasks, etc., and was looking for machine learning PhDs in the medical field. These positions are generally paid, but they only pay you for 65% salary for 110% of the work. However, I was lucky enough to find a 100% paid position. The project is about how to incorporate deep learning, etc., into the curriculum of medicine students, which I think is a really interesting topic and I have always been interested in didactics in general. But the position does not necessarily involve deep learning tasks or programming, just in the form of programming exercises for students, etc. 

The salary is really good for a PhD, and the topic is interesting. However, what can I do with a PhD in Didactiv afterwards?

Here's a little bit about my academic background. I have a Bachelor and Master degree in Physics. After graduating, I worked a researcher with a professor in the area pertaining to mathematical physics and dynamics on curved space for two years. Further, I obtained a master's degree in astronomy and astrophysics (A &amp; A) because it has always fascinated me. I kept in touch with my previous professor with whom I did my mathematical physics research during my master's program in astronomy and astrophysics. A first authored paper based on that research got published recently, and another is in development. Furthermore, during my master's program in A &amp; A, I became deeply interested in computational astrophysics and ML and AI applications in astrophysics.I graduated from the program last year in September 2021 and started applying to various doctoral positions according to my research interests. Besides that, I got an internship as a data scientist in remote sensing was doing well professionally.

Now I got accepted for the following two Ph.D. positions-

1. Ph.D. (Computational Astrophysics) ,Spain-focuses on galaxy and cosmology research.
2. Ph.D. in AI/ML for weather forecasting, Belgium.

My dilemma is what position to accept so that I can have a decent career in case I don't make it further into academia. I understand the uncertainty associated with an academic career and how it may not be possible to achieve tenure-track positions. In that case, I have to look for opportunities in the industry. Therefore, if the previous statement is taken into account and the fact that I have financial responsibilities towards my family ( unmarried btw) now, the second Ph.D. position seems to be a good choice. Considering that the second Ph.D. position will be heavily focused on AI and Data Science, it is more relevant to the job market. In addition, the stipend associated with this PhD position is 800 euro more than the first one, so I will be financially much more secure. However,the computational astrophysics PhD sounds really interesting and is an excellent opportunity. The only downside is the low salary and maybe jumping from one post doc to other until I find a good position. However, if I am unable to do to do so then I have to again find a job as data scientist or ML. Therefore, in that sense the second PhD makes more sense than the first one."

It seems to do this through a complex algorithm that alters syntax and diction while preserving the sentence's original meaning. I find that it's quite effective, and you can run it multiple times to select the optimal iteration of your sentence. Would using a tool like Quillbot be an ethical issue? To be clear, I'm not copying and pasting chunks of articles and feeding them through the bot. I am using it to refine my own writing, which in this case involves paraphrased  information from other articles."

Chinese knockoffs, AI generated content, you name it. Some books I know have been altered from having read them before, other books I don't know are altered because they're new to me. It's difficult to determine if a text is fraudulent without comparing to a known good copy, but finding this copy can be difficult. One way may be to use a textual analysis tool to find words grouped by topic. So if I input a book's text and look for words by category (for example ""food"") it should tell me how statistically likely this book has more words about food than for the average text. If I find a technical manual on computing that has statistically more words related to an unrelated topic (automotive, detective fiction, or beekeeping) then I might be able to assume that the text has been altered in some way.  Does anyone know of any such tools that exist online?"

I did my PhD in Bioinformatics and a 1-year Postdoc (again Bioinformatics) in a prestigious university before joining my current position.

In my current postdoc, almost a year in, Iâ€™ve written 2 papers and a third paper is near completion. Additionally I teach lab practicals, prepare course materials, mentor students, and regularly update my progress with my PI (at least once a week). I have also helped with a grant application and some papers I am not directly involved with. I consider myself a fairly average postdoc and work about 50-60 hours a week.

My PI keeps telling me my performance in my current position is very poor and that I am in danger of termination. Iâ€™ve been told this 4 times over the past year. When I request help with understanding her expectations I am rebuffed and my PI becomes aggressive. Itâ€™s common for her to bang the table, question my credentials and use verbal put-downs like â€œare you kidding me! I feel like Iâ€™m dealing with a PhD studentâ€. Lately Iâ€™ve been asked to take up non-urgent tasks on the weekend, and I also get berated on things I have no control over, such as the progress in a students project. (The project is something I help with but the direction and tasks are assigned by my PI). I am the only Postdoc in this lab and I am isolated from pretty much everyone. Attempts to reach out to other postdocs are thwarted by her (I was told to never collaborate with others but dedicate 100% of my time to producing papers) and she refuses to collaborate internally with other faculty. When I joined this lab the PI claimed she had a collaborator in a highly prestigious institution which turned out to be completely untrue - no meetings or projects ongoing with any collaborator.

Quitting is not an option for me, since I need to consider my childâ€™s schooling and more importantly, the laws are skewed towards my employer. My employer may legally â€˜fineâ€™ me for up to 3 months of pay, which I canâ€™t afford (I only got to know this law once I had been onboarded). I take records of all our interactions. I am trying to cultivate mental toughness so that her behavior does not get to me.

What should my output be in biomedical research as a postdoc, specifically in my field? Iâ€™m thinking that since I work overtime a lot during my weekends I might as well reach out to external faculty for guidance and work on a small paper of my own instead to prop up my record and get a letter of recommendation. Is this a good plan of action? Thanks in advance."

I hope this finds everyone well. M25 and a final year master thesis student here. I got my undergrad in Computer Science and currently pursuing my masters in computer science, focus Big Data and AI. This post is regarding my master thesis topic.

I must write a proposal, get it accepted, get registered this month for my thesis. For various reasons, I still do not have a topic in hand and time is extremely scarce right now. I am interested in ML and AI in the field of music, image classification, etc.

On hearing this, people respond with â€œResearch and find something youâ€™ll like doing or interested inâ€ or â€œTake some time off to figure out what do you want to work inâ€ or â€œIf you donâ€™t get a topic you like working on, youâ€™ll be miserableâ€

I appreciate this but at this moment, given all the circumstances, I NEED to finish my thesis this semester and I need to do it now. I am okay with working on something I do not like or might make me miserable. What I bring in at this moment is knowledge and readiness to slog my ass off to finish the work. I would prefer working with a company as that will allow me to work on the company project and at the same time, gain some working experience.

I have been applying through links and websites, but the process is taking too long, and time is of utmost importance to me right now. I will be happy to share my resume, show sample codes of my work, etc to people who would want to see it. I am hoping to connect to people who will give me a direction to work in or refer me to someone who could give me a way out of this thesis situation.

Since I am posting this, asking for a very particular help/suggestion, you do not have to respond to this if it is not helpful as of now. I do not mean to be rude here to anyone, but on seeing this people just downvote it because, I do not know, maybe they get offended, or they just do not like it.

Please donâ€™t do it. I need the post to have a wider reach so that I have a chance of getting help and it is easy to comment something mean or make my post invisible sitting comfortably somewhere behind a screen. 

At this point, a lot of money and time went behind my education. I know the moral grounds of it and that is why, my ONLY priority right now is finishing it on time, and I am ready to give it my all. I will continue applying to companies and doing my own research.

Reddit can do wonders when times look bleak and Iâ€™m really hoping for a godsend help right now.

Flaired STEM because that's what I do, but I'm sure this kind of thing is also relevant to other non-STEM people. Also, this got way longer than I meant it to be, sorry =)

Hey all - this might be kind of an odd question, but it's been on my mind a lot lately. I'm a 3rd year physics PhD, but I only properly started in this group in the spring, since Covid made it impossible for me to focus on classes and research and my first group was a poor fit. My current group is made up of another 3rd year and two 6th-years who are starting their dissertations and will probably be defending next year, along with a bunch of undergrads.

The details aren't super important, but the main aspects of our group are as follows:
i) simulations based on existing data
ii) data analysis of in-field data,
iii) programming and building circuit boards/other things for data collection,
iv) machine learning/AI for both simulations and real data.

Currently, I'm finishing up my last few required classes (last term of them, woo!), but normally I do mostly (ii) with a dash of (iii). The other third year does mostly simulations, while the two sixth-years have (i) and (iv), respectively, as the focus of their dissertations. (Undergrads usually help out exclusively on either (i) or (iii).) However, since they'll be leaving relatively soon, and my cohort-mate is completely uninterested in the hardware side of things, it'll probably be up to me to pick that up more heavily in the next year.

The thing is, I'm personally interested in both the physical hardware side of things, the machine learning thing, /and/ the programming thing I'm doing currently. My PI is aware of my mix of interests and is supportive of me pursuing multiple at the same time,, so no issues there. I am worrried, though, about graduating and feeling like an expert in anything in particular. Right now, I feel like I don't even understand my own project in-depth, and it's the only thing I'm working on at the moment. I'm a little scared that, as soon as I take on more responsibilities in my group, I'm going to be too spread-out to create a coherent dissertation, even if I do start to feel like I understand what I'm talking about.

(Our group is not very well funded and probably never will be, since it's a pretty niche field, so it's unlikely that we'll get more than 4 new grad students in the next few years, if that. The undergrads are pretty busy with their own classes most of the time, too. This pretty nuch means that I have no chance of /not/ multitasking as part of this group, regardless of if I want to or not.)

The other thing that I'm worried about is the ability for me to get a postdoc after I defend. I'm not 100% sure yet on if I want to try for a TT position or a national lab, but I definitely want a postdoc to try and figure that out. Assuming that I stick with being a jack of all trades, though, I'm worried that I won't have enough experience in anything specific to be competitive for positions that are looking for deeper levels of expertise. This isn't helped by the fact that, when I postdoc, I want to switch from what I'm working on now to another experiment. It's a few years out from being fully constructed, but, in all likelihood, it has very little skill overlap with my current project beyond the AI aspect.

(Oh, and did I mention that I'm interested in multiple projects entirely outside of my field? Still physics, but not even adjacent subfields. In terms of how similar this field is to my current one, think studying swamp ecology instead of DNA.)


TL;DR/my actual question in a nutshell: I have too many things I want to do and don't feel like I can gain expert-level knowledge in any of them. Is it possible for me to get there - with at least one thing, if not multiple - and, if so, how do I actually get that expertise when I'm on a time crunch for my degree?

I just discovered the ChatGPT3 from OpenAI and I'm in love. It has helped me a lot to overcome a creative block I was facing to finish a manuscript from my PhD where 2 of 3 coauthors (the 2 advisors) are quite absent, and for this reason, I stopped working on this manuscript for 1.5 years. Every time I tried to take it back I felt anxious and blocked. However, I'm currently passing a great moment of my life that brings me back to the joying of scientific writing, especially a couple of high-impact manuscript acceptance this last month.  Thus, using the ChatGPT I got the draft of two paragraphs that helped a lot to move fast with this manuscript. Because I'm deeply editing these two paragraphs I think there are no ethical concerns about it. However,  today I ask the ChatGPT to rewrite the paragraph of the objectives in another manuscript that received a minor review. The major concern is the lack of clarity in the objectives. Thus, I just asked to the ChatGPT rewrite this in a clearer manner and nail it. The paragraph is amazing now and I'm planning to use it directly as it is in the manuscript to send back to the journal. My question however is if I'm pushing the ethical line far from the gray area and if I can be punished in the future for this approach.

Right now AI can make up legit-looking but not real sources so they're easy to check by just looking up the citations. Additionally, IME many AI-generated pieces are fairly stilted in their language use.

But some day that won't be the case. In fact, some day it may be possible that AI can essentially create an otherwise legitimate, well-done paper (as in, pull real sources together and create a novel document from them) with little student input.

How do you think higher ed will adapt? (I'm thinking mostly about teaching/testing students, but if you want to talk about research and scientific writing, feel free!) 

I feel like if we can somehow get away from this ""college is to get a job"" so that many/most students don't actually care about the learning but are just there to check a box we might be able to just generally reduce the impetus to cheat in general, but that will require some significant societal change.

I was thinking that in many fields that might ask you to write a paper (as opposed to sit an exam during class time where you couldn't access an AI bot) we may benefit from giving up the ""arms race"" and returning to a model of oral examinations. Each student meets with the instructor (small classes) or 1-2 TAs in a team of several (larger classes) and basically take an oral examination. Examinations can be recorded for review if there are complains/questions afterward. 

But then I thought about how many students these days have anxiety-related or similar concerns if not full out accommodations and how much that would probably increase if students knew they'd regularly have to do oral examinations. Additionally, it may be hard to have every student receive fair, equal-difficulty tests without giving them the same questions to answer, yet if you give them all the same questions it would be difficult to prevent early test takers from telling others what they will be asked.

So I am curious, what do y'all see as the way forward in a world of AI bots doing homework?"

ChatGPT responded: Hello fellow professors,

I recently came across a new AI tool called chatgpt that is being marketed as a way for students to get quick answers to their homework questions. While I understand the temptation for students to use this tool in order to save time, I believe it poses a significant risk for cheating in the classroom.

Chatgpt is an AI chatbot that uses machine learning algorithms to generate responses to questions. It can be accessed through a website or an app, and students can input their homework questions to get answers. While the tool claims to provide only general information and not specific solutions, I am concerned that students may use it to find answers to specific questions on exams or assignments.

In my opinion, this tool undermines the educational process and devalues the hard work and effort that students should put into their studies. It also creates an unfair advantage for those who use it, as they are essentially cheating their way through coursework.

I urge fellow professors to be vigilant in detecting and preventing the use of chatgpt in their classrooms. It is important that we maintain the integrity of our courses and ensure that all students are held to the same standards.

What are your thoughts on chatgpt and the possibility of students cheating with its use? Have you encountered this tool in your classrooms? How have you addressed it?

I look forward to hearing your insights and experiences.

Educators can maintain academic integrity in an environment where students may be using AI chat software by implementing a few different strategies. Some examples include:

Monitoring students' work and identifying any suspicious patterns or similarities between submissions

Using plagiarism detection software to check for instances of copied text

Providing detailed instructions and guidelines for assignments, and making sure students understand the importance of original work

Encouraging students to cite their sources properly and to understand the difference between paraphrasing and plagiarism

Having clear policies in place for dealing with academic dishonesty, and enforcing those policies consistently and fairly

One of my graduate students (third year) is great in many ways but has one significant weakness. I can't precisely describe it but the symptoms are 

* the student doesn't ask themselves if a result (analytical or numerical) is correct in a certain limit or if ""it makes sense"". So often the results are wrong because a simple check was not performed. 
* is not curious or playful with results. What does the result imply? Can I extend it?
* doesn't try to figure out what do to next in a project

Two of our external collaborators have noticed this issue too. Both have tried to speak to the graduate student about this issue. I've had 9 Graduate students and never had this issue before.

If so, how would you spin it so its actually positive?

I had a freshman in a GenEd class who did ultimately get a good grade, but was very, very difficult as a personality. In my experience, he was grade-grubby and demanding, and weirdly rude and disrespectful throughout the semester. For instance, he'd make an appointment to see me and then come 20 or 30 minutes late. When we did meet, he basically wanted me to give the green light on his drafts, and would generally resist and argue with me about any substantive feedback I tried to give. When he did acknowledge small errors (for instance,  I had pointed out he was mixing up plural s and possessive s), he then proceeded to do the easy edits right then and there, expecting me to sit there waiting because (in his own words) he just wanted to submit it to the LMS right away to get it off his plate and didnt want to do the content revisions. So too , he was very demanding in email. If he emailed at 11 pm and I hadnt written back within a few hours, hed email again. This was a pattern throughout the semester... him emailing or wanting to meet very frequently about work to 'pre-guarantee' a good grade (as though merely having talked with the teacher should ensure the A whether or not the work was good) while generally showing very little regard for my feedback or time, and explicitly telling me that he just wanted to get X done, or didn't have time to learn or revise Y..... all while soaking up hours and hours of my email and office hours time.  Even though he scored well on MC type tests, he just seemed to have the thinnest sort of work ethic only concerned with points and not at all with actual learning or earning.

At one point at the end of the semester when he kept pestering me after class about something I had already given him feedback on (wanting to know whether he could just submit it as-is or whether I would make him fix it), I finally got kind of fed up with it and shifted into 'mentoring' or correcting mode. I told him that he was coming across very aggressive about his grades and was giving the impression of only caring about points and not any of the content. He seemed very surprised, and then did then seem to 'see' himself and how he was acting. He actually cried and said he struggles with anxiety and didn't mean to come across as though he only cared about the grades; but he also acknowledged this was true... that he doesn't really know what he wants to do with his life, and is often just trying to score the points or get the high GPA. He acknowledged that even *he* sometimes felt he was just scrambling and using people (professors, peers) to try to get the most points for himself (yeah, we could all tell!) and that he *didn't* really care about anything he was learning. He said things were not going great in his other classes either. It was a rather sincere and honest sort of moment of conversation, and he seemed just like a very competitive yet confused 18 yr old, (which of course is what a lot of our students are!) I had expected him to double-down like usual, so was myself surprised that he broke out of what I'd experienced thus far as a kind of 'immature asshole' mode. So of course I then shifted into a more encouraging mode to assure him he can succeed in college and in life, and to encourage him to figure out what he really cares about and to apply himself to that. So probably 35% of the conversation was calling him to task, and then 65% was in supportive mentor mode. At the end of the semester about two weeks later, he reiterated thanks to me for talking with him, and we seemed to end in a mostly good place; he did score high enough on the final exam and presentation to earn the A he wanted, (though honestly the final essay and presentation were subjective types of assignment and I would have been very wary to give him anything less than an A in the course or else probably spend all of Winter Break fielding complaint emails about it& Not proud of this, but he had *really* worn me down).

At any rate, to my utter shock, he's now reached out for a letter of rec to transfer universities. After calling him to task, I'm kind of surprised he is asking me for a letter at all.... since I was (inwardly pretty frustrated with him) and outwardly did basically tell him to shape up attitude-wise.  Why would he ask me for a letter of rec from ME? Amazingly, in the email, he doesn't seem too resentful of me taking him to task but thanked me again for urging him to be better.

But should I write him the letter? My experience of him during the semester was so negative that I am not really sure what I would say in a letter about his work ethic or character. And though I could talk positively about the humble/honest/ searching side of him I saw break through at the end in this conversation, obviously to explain all of the above probably would not do him any favors in his application. To say something like, 'he acted like an entitled a-hole to me and his group mates all semester, but at the end then admitted that and turned out to be a scared teenager underneath"" is hardly a ringing endorsement. I feel like I probably *should* write the letter (if he seriously has no better professor relations from this first semester?) to help him in whatever his long term goals and growth are.... but only if it will actually help him. I just don't know how to 'spin' it in a way that would actually serve him well.

I could use some perspective and help in seeing what is actually right in terms of the recommendation&. Whether to do it, how to do it honestly without letting my own frustration weigh here inappropriately, what positive thing to highlight if not the conversion moment&?"

Can it help students learn more effectively without edging close to cheating? Can it make the task of teaching more wholesome and intuitive? What kind of safeguards do we need to ensure that ChatGPT has a positive impact on students? 

I'd love to hear your opinions. I would also appreciate a brief call/interview if you got a few minutes to spare. Thanks a bunch. Have a lovely day/eve ahead!"

Thanks!

AI Use Policy  Jan 2023 Draft

The AI landscape is evolving rapidly. The Graduate School of ..... does not consider the use of AI (e.g., ChatGPT) as a primary or secondary source (unless the topic under study is AI text output).  At this time, it is unclear where an AI is drawing its information from, and if the AI provides citations, we do not know if they are accurate. Further, we do not know whether any given content generated by an AI is plagiarized.

Here is initial guidance for students. Students are permitted to utilize AI in their written work under the following conditions:

(1) Students may use AI for brainstorming purposes or to explore topics, but any text created from AI is not considered to be scholarship. Students are responsible for finding the primary sources where the information was derived. They must locate and read the original source of the AI output and must paraphrase and appropriately cite the original source content.

(2) Students are not permitted to turn in work for essays and assignments created by AI even if they paraphrase the AI-generated content and cite the AI software as the source. An exception would be if AI-generated content was being used as an example of AI text generation. In such a case, the AI would be cited as the source of the material.

(3) Using AI-generated text in coursework outside of the guidelines above may result in a report of academic dishonesty and program probation."

Actually, I don't think there are rules against it; we video classes all the time, often showing all the students in the class. The problem isn't technology; I think, with a few days' fiddling, I could work out how to use some of the open AI object/person recognition libraries, and I'm hoping they could be trained to identify individual students. It should be possible, even for a non-professional-AI-person like myself, to then produce a montage of just one student's presence in class throughout 30+ class periods. We could watch it in my office after they complain to the chair before even telling me what they're upset about. We could see how often they were on their phone, how often they asked questions, and how often they were even there.

That's not the problem. The problem is that none of it fucking matters. I'm building castles in the sky, here. I already have ten times the evidence I would have needed 15 years ago to fail a student who failed to do the work (or give a student *gasp* a B when they did B-level work). The problem is that my chair and dean would do what they've done for a decade at this institution: chastise me for not being ""student centered"" enough, threaten me with career-damaging or -destroying consequences if I don't make students happy, etc.

Yes, I've only been back at work a week.

*Edit*: Some of y'all got a bit triggered by this. I guess I should have put a warning. 

I'm never seriously going to do this (largely because I couldn't get away with it, for various reasons); I have lots of big ideas, most of which turn out to be not the greatest plans ever. This is probably one of them. I'm still struck by the fact that my institution has made it abundantly clear that faculty can (and will) be scrutinized in various ways, and if we are found to be imperfect in any aspect of our teaching (by the definition of whichever administrator has just heard student complaints), our efforts are judged to be essentially worthless, and should be overturned because a student feels upset about a grade. I'm reminded of a semester in which I gave many low-stakes evaluations (brief quizzes, response papers), and when a student complained about their course grade, the chair and dean decided that my ""lack of organization"" was a reason why the student's complaint had merit. The student failed most of the assessments and simply didn't turn in a lot of them (partly because they skipped a lot of classes). My ""lack of organization"" was, in that case, the fact that I had extended the deadlines for two or three things when multiple students said they needed more time.

I think the fact that thoughts of my current institution almost always prompt thoughts with the word ""fuck"" embedded in them might mean I'm burnt out.

*Edit 2*: Huh. Apparently [NYU Learn already does this](https://steinhardt.nyu.edu/learn), much more creepily than I was envisioning. Look for it from an educorporate ""partner"" soon. Thanks for the heads-up, /u/doktor-frequentist"

1. Plagiarism detection software: Many plagiarism detection tools are able to identify text that has been generated by AI and flag it as potential plagiarism.

2. Manual review: You can also manually review the essays and look for signs that the text has been generated by AI, such as repetitive sentence structures, lack of coherence, or text that is overly formal or uses uncommon words.

3. Prohibiting the use of outside sources: You can also prohibit the use of any outside sources during the writing process, and make sure that the student turns in the final copy of the essay with the original work.

4. Asking for the original work and comparing it with the final copy: You can also ask for the original work and compare it with the final copy, if there are any similarities or differences that could indicate that the student used some kind of external sources.

It's important to note that ChatGPT is a language model and its main goal is to generate human-like text, so it's possible that an essay written by a student using GPT might not be flagged as plagiarism by plagiarism detection software, but it will show signs of being generated by AI."

However, the very nature of our education means that it is less likely to be disrupted by AI tech like ChatGTP, DALL-E-2 and MusicLM. I expect these will be transformational tools to unlock creativity that will sit alongside our known methods and traditions.

The pearl-clutching over AI tools is more about an attack on the scale and economics of traditional educational delivery and assessment.

For a faculty already overworked and overwhelmed, I completely understand this concern.

These tools will forever change how we assess student learning. We needed to do that work anyway if we are committed to making higher education more accessible and equitable. Creative education models show a path forward, but the affordability problem needs to be solved."

I also plan to address it with my students and have them play around with it in class to learn what it's good for and where it fails. But for now, I've used it to save myself time in these ways:

\- Wrote a letter of rec for a student going to grad school. I have a template I use and customize for each student, but I'm tired of it. I gave it some details about the student and their goals, and it wrote an incredible letter that I only had to fix parts of to make it work.

\- Wrote a draft of a bylaws change for our University Senate. 

\- Wrote a motion for our University Senate complete with justification.

\- Wrote 2 prompts for assignments. The results even included a rubric I could tweak for my own requirements.

\- Wrote discussion questions and prompts for classes.

\- Brainstormed an in-class activity involving group work where each group completes a different part of the assignment.

\- Wrote a ""welcome back to the semester"" email for my advisees with key dates for registration.

It definitely has limitations. The assignment prompts follow a standard template, but that works for me. But it's brilliant to use when you're stuck or your brain just doesn't know how to flesh something out.

First time posting here.

I notified the chair of my program, who relayed this to our dean, and apparently there are several other professors that have noticed the same trend in their own classes.

Today some of these accounts introduced themselves in the ""meet &amp; greet"" discussion board of my classes and to my dismay most of these posts seemed eerily similar and a bit odd (bot-ish if you get my meaning). Perhaps someone out there is using an AI to generate a text blurb to this end?

In any case, I was wondering if this is an isolated occurrence, or if anyone else has experienced, noticed or heard about something similar happening.

A student is not doing well. I also sense some emotional blackmail from the student.

Last semester, this student begged me to accept him into my class for the third time. The past two times, he failed. I said I'm willing to give one more chance. The result? He failed again.

He missed the finals in Dec. After all this, he wrote me a snippy email that he was sick, so I told him the syllabus states he can offer a doctor's note to be excused and to make different arrangements.

Nothing came out of this. Instead, he kept being pushy that I should accept his final paper that was less than 50% of the requirements - like 2 pages instead of 8-10 pages. I felt harassed and wrote back ""Sorry but your emergency doesn't constitute an emergency on my part.""

Snarky you say? OK, I accept that. I was livid after playing this game for several semesters.

Yesterday changes the story. This student reappeared and asked if he can submit a medical note. I was thinking 'Here we go again' but said sure.

The student said he was diagnosed with cancer several months back and gave documentation. Then he selected my quote, told me it was insensitive, and scolded me to be more careful in the future and be kind to students.

I am concerned about this student and his health problem. I also am amazed he did not inform me of his health issue in Nov or offer documentation in Dec. Only this cancer diagnosis in Feb.

What am I supposed to do? Pass the student out of sympathy for his medical problems? Tell him to do last semester's work while he is sick?

Honestly, I have zero confidence he will do any of the work. I know, because I've been worn down by three semesters of games from this student. He also has violated academic integrity before, so I would not be surprised if he uses AI to submit something.

But still...a cancer diagnosis?

[Edit: The ""documentation"" the student provided does NOT state the student has cancer. It states that the visit is ""routine"" and the family has high risk of cancer. It isn't signed by any medical professional. The student has lied several times before, so there is no trust. He has done almost no work for three semesters, although he promised otherwise.

I am teaching a first-year comms class and asked students to complete an academic integrity workshop and write a reflection on their experiences (i.e., what they learned, what they found interesting, etc). This assignment is worth 5% of their grade.

I have one student who submitted their reflection and there are some pretty big indications it was written by AI (or plagiarized at the very least (yes, I know the irony of them plagiarizing for a reflection on academic integrity). For instance, there is a clear color difference between fonts. Their writing is in black font. The seemingly generated text is a darkish gray. There is also a clear difference in writing style. The suspected text only uses third-person pronouns (us, we, etc), whereas their original text uses first-person (I did this, I thought). For context, English is not the first language of this student, but it isn't for at least a third of the class.

The bit that I suspect has been generated by AI talks very broadly about the ethical importance of academic integrity. 

I've put the paper through an AI detection software, and it says it was possibly generated by AI compared to another student's which passed the detection test. I've also tried access chatgpt, but it is down. 

We spent a whole lecture talking about academic integrity and information literacy at the beginning of the semester.

I need advice on this situation. Do I go to my dean? Do I confront the student? Do I just grade the parts they wrote? I have no hard evidence beyond my own observations and suspicions."

I havenâ€™t had the technology tools to truly catch cheating at this level, sometimes Iâ€™ll find just by reading that some students work is identical and give zeros. But the students push back and want to resubmit and claim I never said it was â€œindividual workâ€.  

Anyway - due to the above issues - in class almost no one is working. Theyâ€™re working on other class assignments or playing games etc and itâ€™s become a behavior management issue. 

I recently noticed that on the community college side, I can enable turn it in.com for all assignments. So I tried it out. Out of 98 students = 20 were identical. And many had copied/pasted from the internet - prob up to 50%+ of the students had at least a few answers completely copied/pasted. 

It was a simple assignment and I am going to notify them that going forward Iâ€™m enabling turnitin on every single item submitted to try and get them to actually put forth their own effort. 

Are there any instructors here who have suggestions?

I have tried doing quizzes over assignments instead of just drop boxes - the quiz is timed and one try only - but they can still cheat. I am not dead set on eliminating all academic dishonesty (I think that is likely impossible) but I would like to minimize it and get them out of the habit of literally never mentally engaging in any work. 

Iâ€™m also dealing with students openly speaking about using AI to complete assignments in other classes so I am certain, theyâ€™re not above doing it in mine. 

I know itâ€™s Feb and we only have about 60 or so days left in the school year so Iâ€™m realistic that this could be an uphill battle. Any and all suggestions are welcome!"

I know I am late to jump on the AI train, yet I just came across a glitch in ChatGPT that I thought might be of interest here:

I was playing around and asked for papers on a topic Iâ€™ve been working on. ChatGPT recommended a few papers that absolutely fit that (including brief summaries of their content) and that were published in some of the most renowned journals in my field.

To be honest: This had me panicking for a moment: How could Iâ€™ve missed these (been working in this project for well over a year now)â€¦?

I looked them up (ChatGPT gave a full reference in APA-style) and none of these existed. Asked back and was given other â€œofficialâ€ looking references for these (altered title and altered journal). Again, none of these existed.

Searched extensively for the authors (of which I had not heard before, but that sounded similar to authors I knew). Andâ€¦ you guessed it: non existent as well.

On the one hand this shows the limits of an otherwise cool technology but it also had me thinking in terms of teaching: these references looked absolutely genuine at first sight and if a student had used them in a paper, chances are that I would not have noticed that.

I am guessing a lot of people here are on hiring committees. Could you please give me some information? 

1. How do you use the ranking/name of the school of applicants? Is there any rubric or fixed ""percentage/weight"" you assign to it?

2. If two applicants with similar publication record apply would you reject the lower ranked person? or, would you call both for interview?

3. What ranking do hiring committees even follow? There seems to be quite a bit of difference between different websites linke USnews and CSrank. In this case, the univ near 40 and 65 are both instead ranked near 50 in CSrank.

I'm not saying don't do the rants/vents. They're cathartic. Shouting out into the internet can help your mental health sometimes. No judgement here. I do it all the time.

I came into academia after 15 years in industry and was pretty shocked with the changes, or at least, my perceived changes now that I was far removed and on the other side. I almost left teaching after my first year out of frustration, but stuck it out. Then, Covid happened and, well, I don't have to tell you how that all went and how it still is reverberating. I have taken lessons from the situation and worked to keep my standards while building in a bit more of equity for students to help them get back on track.

When I say structure, I mean your class setup and polices. Students need structure. Most of them are not learning how to learn or being taught how to college. Not giving them that, of course a lot of them are going to ""fail"". And you may think ""that's not my job!"" And to you I say ""BS"". It's in your best interest and the students' best interest for you to address it and honestly it doesn't take a whole lot more effort or whole cloth rewrite of your course. Nor does it take away your standards. In fact, it helps students meet them and makes your life easier.

Every line in my syllabus and instructions comes out a student not meeting or misinterpreting my expectations or just general college expectations. 

You have to have an attendance policy. That's number one. They signed up for this class at this time. The expectation is they be there. You're not doing them any favors by not having them and thinking it's only about the things you assess for. When a student is in class they benefit from things ranging from being introduced to concepts, being able to ask questions (even if most don't, some do, and all hear the answer), seeing ""good"" students do things to model off of, hearing you riff on your subject/other thoughts, getting immediate feedback, doing a guided activity, etc. And communicate those reasons to the students. Even if some students aren't fully paying attention, there's the 'osmosis factor'. I still give a number of 'free' absences (3, which is 10% of my class periods) because life happens. But I also have an upper limit where they automatically fail the course (8 - 25% of class) unless there's something like hospitalization. In the middle I reduce their final grade logarithmically. Full disclosure, my biggest course only has 60 students with most of my other classes being 20 student workshops. I make the TAs have students sign in to the 60 class.

A lot don't even know how to take notes. Consider skeleton notes. It's a very equitable way to help them take notes. Some can't hear or see as well. Some are a little slower on listening or writing. It also cues a student who doesn't take notes and pay attention to do it and they perceive it as easier as they don't have to frantically write or figure out how to best structure their notes. Don't mistake your capacity and ability to take notes as true for everyone. I require they turn them in. I don't grade based on accuracy, just a checkmark of points if from 30,000 feet they look fine and have all the pages.

Probably the only other really required thing is a late work policy. I take off 10% as soon as it's past due and then 5% each additional 24 hours. I don't accept work later then a week past due. That cuts off any end of the semester BS. I make no exceptions (other than hospitalization).

Another equitable thing I do is make all things due right at the beginning of a class. None of this midnight BS. Some students actually have terrible internet. You're not paying for it. And some places have terrible internet. By making it due then, they can get to class a couple minutes early and upload to the system. If there's some real 'issue with the LMS', you are there to verify it. If they didn't come in and there was an issue, you just hit them with the late penalty. It's on them. I actually had a student complain to me once about having it due before the class. Which blew my mind. But I told him it's a due date, not a do date, and shared why I do it.

I do offer 1 or 2 72-hour extensions for any exercise in my classes that students can use no questions asked, but they have to shoot me an email telling me they're using it. I generally don't start grading within that time period anyway, so it's no skin off my apple. And, that way they know they only have the 1 or 2. I don't get begging emails. And it makes me look like a star because I build it right in and let them know that I realize they have 5 bosses that don't coordinate. I also track these extensions in the LMS as their own item, so they can see if they have any left. Once they're out, they're out. I'd say about half of any given class uses them. And it causes me no issue.

But I never give those extensions for larger, multi-week projects. They have to time manage in that case. But what I like to do on these projects is have concrete items that have to be done at various due times or they lose points. I don't want students banging out the whole thing in one night. I break major projects into deliberate smaller deliverables such as research/exploration/ideation/drafts. I make checklists of what those deliverables entail. This, by the way, is how I think more classes will have to work as things like ChatGPT become standard. I also try to build in a peer group critique session if I can. That way students get insight into how others are approaching. I structure those as well by making them use the rubric and some guiding questions as they talk about each others' work.

Which brings me to rubrics. I never once had a rubric in college. When I got here, students demanded them. And now I love them. It takes as much 'voodoo' out as possible and speeds up grading. It communicates exactly what and to what level I am looking for of various skills. They have cons too, like what I call 'checkmarking' by students where they try to hit those items but somehow the piece as a whole doesn't hold together. But I now have some qualitative items in it to account for that. But, let's face it, grade inflation is what it is...

I will also say, your context means you have to think about what your real expectations can be. I teach all upper class students in my major. I'll admit that I'll tell my students that if push comes to shove, it's my class they should put more time and effort in than their gen eds. I'm sure that will bristle some of you. But, what I'm teaching in a professional program honestly will help their specific goals more. If they can do both well, by all means they should. But I call a spade a spade. I also harp on the fact that grades don't really matter in the real world. Focus on learning. Obviously, that is a bit lost on a lot of them.

If I taught gen ed, my expectations would be pretty different. Not that gen eds aren't important, but, let's face it, they're less important on the whole to the student than their major classes. Stick to a few objectives like writing and critical thinking. Or how your subject actually relates to their real world and not just knowledge for the sake of knowledge. But accept that most of them are not there because they love the subject and are in any way invested. I floated through a lot of my gen eds, and I bet a lot of you did too. I literally can barely remember any gen eds or my gen ed professors. Nor have I used any specific rote items other than the odd Jeopardy question. What I have used are skills like learning, thinking, argument, writing, etc. I know a lot of the rants are about those very skills. That's why you need to clearly communicate to the students that that is a real goal of the class, don't assume they know it. It might actually make them appreciate it more. Share more about those strategies and a little less about the topic to get them on your page. Not much. It can be as simple as 510 minutes at the end of a class discussing strategies for what you're asking them to do for assignments or how to study or whatever. Not the instructions, but the meta concepts. They won't remember any of your subject unless you draw a clear line to how it affects their actual lives besides getting a grade to pass.

I also point out constantly how much time any given course should take outside of class. A 3 credit class expects you to work 6 hours outside of class according to my University. I remind them when I assign something. If a student doesn't do the work, I remind them again. If someone complains they 'spend so much time on it' I ask them 'how much time'? Some think a half hour or hour is so much time. I will say 6 seems like a lot and really 5 hours each class and going to the classes is a 40 hour week. I know some have jobs and things, but it is what it is. They chose to be here and their goal is to learn, not just pass through and get a degree for paying for their tuition. They have to carve out the time. I think a bit too many in modern college think it's for socialization and the classes are more an inconvenience from that. You have to tell them they are mistaken. Yes, that matters, but that can't be the focus. Work hard, play hard is fine, but you can't just play hard and forget that first part. Students having to work is a real confounding factor that I feel bad for and part of the systemic issues of our society, but I can't solve everything and sometimes life sucks before it gets better.

As far as backbone, I'm talking about yours. You are not there to be their friends. A friend will back up your buddy in a bar fight even though they were the one being the a\*\*hole. You are there to be their teacher and mentor. A lot of times, that means telling them they're being an a\*\*hole. Obviously, you have to say that in a nice way and also teach them how to not be that way. But you have to be fine playing the heavy. You're a full adult. They are not. They are still on the runway to adulthood. Some less far than others. Some will hate you for it. That's kind of your job. I even get a little tickle of excitement when I pass a student in the hallway that I know hates my guts just because I asked them to grow.

You have to stick to your policies. If you build in that structure and some of that equity I talked about earlier, it's pretty easy to then just look them in they eye and say ""That's the policy. I can't change it for you or I'd have to change it for everyone."" And you say that to students you both like and don't like. No one is above the policies.

There will still be jerk students who will trash you on RMP and course evals. Oh well. I've actually stopped reading both. Unless admin calls me in about eval scores, I assume I'm fine. I like to tell people I went into teaching because of the movie Dead Poet's Society. But, when I rewatched it, I realized that not everyone stands on their desk in the end. You can't reach everyone. You can't be liked by everyone. Plus, you know, life isn't a movie. No one is standing on their desk in the first place. Most will not remember you. You probably won't remember most of them. You might not even be more than a blip in their life and vice versa.

I also see ""a few students take all your emotional energy"". And, up until I came to this realization of all I've said, I thought that too. But, these students aren't tying you down and making you feel. You are in control of your emotional energy. I used to brood for the rest of the day when I had a bad interaction with a student or work came in and it wasn't up to my expectations. Now, that I have the structure I feel is both fair to hold my standards and fair to be equitable to students because I really am there to help them, I don't let that happen. I shrug it off because I know I'm in the right. If they are being entitled or selfish, that's not on me. I have no problem looking a student dead in the eye and just telling them ""Listen, I know it's not what you want to hear, but that's the way it is because of my policies, which I believe are more than fair. This matter is closed as far as I'm concerned."" And showing them the door. Have the memory of a goldfish about these matters. I know it's easier said than done, but put that same emotional energy into the ""good"" students and interactions. And a good student doesn't mean a good grade student, but someone who is engaged and trying. 

And, yes, some students might try to make some argument about wording in a policy, but I just tell them this isn't constitutional law. It's my intention that matters, not their interpretation. They could have clarified before taking any action. That's on them. It would have to be egregiously ambiguous language for me to concede. But the more I've dealt with things, the more revision I have. And I use the same policies in all my classes to keep it consistent. So that's not likely to happen. Most of the times its because they misremember what you said and didn't bother consulting the written instructions or policy.

About accommodations. I feel like they are being handed out like candy. I fully admit that, despite my own mental health issues, I don't put the same respect to ones that are probably from that rather than physical issues. Which I guess is good why they don't tell you what they're for to keep my bias in check. Not that they still don't annoy me. At least at my school, the accommodations are less requirements as suggestions. I tell students that my policies are already built with some equity for people who don't even know they can get accommodations, so they aren't getting double whatever is being asked, such as absences and late work. A couple more at most. And I hold the line at 8 absences as a fail without hospitalization. I already provide all my slides, so that's no issue for me. And if they need notes, I tell them my slides are my notes, which they are. If they need note-taking, remember that skeleton notes thing? You can ask another student to share with them. Anything I feel is unreasonable I have no problem telling them it won't work for me. Hasn't happened much. Some students think they get carte blanche or are retroactive. I tell them they are mistaken. We also have a contract we are supposed to fill out with a student when they share their accommodations. That way it's detailed in writing and signed by both of us. I suggest you do the same.

Lastly, students may like to say 'well Professor X let's me do...' Or something about past stuff they used to get away with. And to that I say 'well gas used to cost $2 a gallon until Biden raised the prices.' Just kidding. I don't say that. I'm a socialist liberal who acknowledges the complicated global economy. But I tell them that it doesn't matter as that was a different context and different expectations. I'm not Professor X (first of all, I can walk is that X-men joke ablest?) and the two have nothing to do with the other. That's not how life works. Requirements can be different in different contexts. 

I don't want this to come off holier than thou or for anyone to think I think I'm a paragon of teaching. I know I'm not and I am still constantly learning and evolving. Maybe my context is different than yours. But this is where I'm at after teaching 4/4 for close to a decade, surviving the pandemic, and feeling like I've never been happier with or better at teaching. It was a bumpy road to get here and I still have periods of sadness and frustration. But I thought it might help some of you. Obviously, you're free to not take any of this advice or add more advice below."

We didn't intend to build it specifically for any kind of student, but we started to get positive feedback that this tool could be helpful for educational organizations and students in general.

A quick overview of how it works:

With two hours to go, exactly none of the roughly ninety students have submitted the paper.  This in spite of the fact that my office hours were flooded with students asking questions, most of which were explicitly covered in the verbal and written instructions for this assignment (they've had a month and multiple reminders about this).  

Some gems from today alone:

""Can I write on \[story we covered in class\] and copy and paste the notes you posted?""  (No, that's plagiarism.)

""Can I use a paper I wrote for another class?"" (No, that's plagiarism.)

""Can I submit the same paper I turned in last time?"" (No, that's...wait, what?)

""Can we use one of those AI generators?"" (No, that's plagiarism...also, let's stop for a bit and review plagiarism.)

""You've never mentioned this assignment.  Can I get an extension?"" (So many reminders, but it's also in your syllabus, on your course calendar, and has been on the freaking whiteboard every class for the past two weeks.)

""I'm too tired for this.  Can I get an extension?""  (You and me both.  Also, no.)

""You said last time that I need a title.  I don't know what that means.""  (...le sigh.)

From student who came to my office five minutes before my office hours ended: ""I don't understand this assignment.  Can you go over all of it?""  (Student then wanted me to stay later so I could keep answering questions that were in the instructions.  No.  You've had a month to work on this.  I'm going home.)

""Can you stay online until I'm done?  I might not finish on time, but I promise I'll be done by 1 AM. 2 AM at the latest."" (No.  I need to do that thing where I'm unconscious for a time.)

""How much will I lose if I turn it in late?"" When reminded there's a 10% deduction per calendar day,   
 ""That's too much.  Can you make it 1%?"" (No.)

After my generous office hours had already ended: ""I can't find your office. Can you meet me at \[building that's a ten minute walk across campus\]?"" (No.  I'm home.  I'm staying home.)

I will get some amazing papers, because I have some amazing students, but maaaan, they're wearing me out tonight."

I thought I'd come here and rant like everyone else is, but with a different take.   
I don't trust anything anymore.  It's awful and it's causing arrest in my work.  

I love grading essays.  I'm a writing teacher.  It's what I do, it's what I teach, what I research, and like you folks who work in labs, this is our proving ground.  Writing is thinking.  It's exploration.  It's the opportunity for a writer to take a position on something they care about, do research in an area they want to know more about, their contribution to the conversation of whatever field they're engaging.   
 Usually I read an essay and learn something.  Even the struggling essays still bring something to the table - sometimes you can look at a poor writer and at least see how they're trying.

But now, I'm so biased because I'm implicitly suspicious.  I can't get away from it.  Is that verbose introduction an AI overusing demonstrative pronouns? ( This is... This is also... This is also...) or is it just a young writer who doesn't know better?  Is the introduction taking a tangent because the student is working through the thought process in a draft, or is it an AI adding unnecessary details because it doesn't know better?  
It's killing me.  
There wass a part of me going into this semester that ""the AI will only go so far"" but am I now critiquing AI writing that the student's just going to tinker with for the next month, or is this essay genuinely their exploration of ideas? The topic is theirs - right?  But is this their thoughts?  If they have no investment, and its just an AI's product, what am I doing with this?  In the pre-AI days, even if they didn't want to write the essay, and the students are just in the room because they have to be (the unfortunate byproduct of required classes), at least THEY did something.  But now?  I just don't know, and it's sapping the drive completely.  I don't want to critique an AI's work.  I don't have the opportunity to sit down with every single student and have a conversation about their projects (there's not enough time- 3 x 20-per-class = 60 students.  160 minutes worth of class time in a week - it would take two weeks of class time just to have a 5min conversation with each student, and I can't lose that time).    
I'm going back to the grading now, because I have to, but I really think the essay I'm looking at right now is AI-generated.  I'll do it because I have to, but it really hurts.  This isn't what I did so much work for - to teach people how to revise AI-generated essays.  I don't know how to make this prejudice feeling go away.  
Rant over."

Any thoughts you have on it would be appreciated. It seems that AI is irreversible, and instead of telling students that they cannot use it, they need to be taught how to use it responsibly. This is my best attempt to achieve that goal.

**The Ethical Use of Artificial Intelligence:**

As artificial intelligence becomes more prevalent in our daily lives, it is crucial for students to understand the ethical considerations surrounding its use in academic settings. In this course, students are expected to use AI in a manner which upholds the values of academic integrity. In general, the use of AI should never compromise development in critical thinking, research, and analysis. Along that line, the use of AI to generate content, manipulate the tone of work, create data, or summarize/shorten an authorâ€™s work for quicker consumption is considered academic dishonesty and strictly prohibited.

Alternatively, students are encouraged towards using AI to assist in research and writing process in ways which encourage the learning process and mitigate menial tasks. For example, students may use AI to create a table to help visualize complex data, develop personalized learning and reading plans, and assist in correcting grammar and spelling errors.

Please note that any unethical use of AI in this course will be considered academic dishonesty and may result in disciplinary action. Students are responsible for ensuring that their use of AI is in compliance with the course policies on academic integrity."

I have found that chatGPT has greatly reduced the bottle neck of mundane writing that I often face. My main responsibility in my role is ensuring conceptual coordination and academic consistency, which is detracted from when I have to spend hours editing other peoples writing or write basic but time consuming sections. By using chatGPT, I have been able to spend less time on my more menial tasks and have become incredibly more productive. Since discovering chatGPT I have doubled my academic output.

I enjoy talking about stuff online. And so I used to love online courses because the discussion boards were a great way to just talk about this stuff online. I'd open the week by just posing some questions that don't take too much thought in order to get the ball rolling, some students would stumble through, the engaged ones would make really interesting posts, and as long as someone met the word count, necessary number of replies, they'd get full credit. It was the ""can you fog a mirror"" backstop for the student grade. What few plagiarists there were were easy to spot because I could open another tab and do a Google search. The whole thing generally approached being fun.

Then ChatGPT rolled around. Now, any answer that's too polished means that instead of being excited, I find myself wondering if a robot wrote it. I'll enter one of my questions into ChatGPT, and sure enough, the cadences and tone that get spit back out at me will nearly exactly match the student's post.

I've been slinging zeros right and left, I've been filing reports with the office of student conduct, and we're still two and a half days out from Spring Break. And it's not just in the surveys! I've been getting students in 400-level classes outsourcing their posting to Chat GPT as well. 

I mean, my initial post isn't really even prompts. It's just basically meant to get the ball rolling while we shoot the shit about what we've read. So of course the questions I'll raise are the sort of question that's been raised before in the history of the whole internet and so of course Chat GPT can paraphrase the answers.

I just don't know what to do. Do I just drop discussion boards from online courses altogether, do proctored quizzes and tests, and hope that Turnitin can hire programmers that can figure out how to spot robot answers for formal writing assignments? Just say eff it, no ""you can fog a mirror"" discussion credit because cheaters have ruined it for everyone?

I'm not upset that programmers have finally figured out how to crack the Turing Test. Hell, as a curious guy, I find it fascinating that researchers resorted to pattern matching because trying to teach machines to understand concepts was mostly a dead end.

But... was the only thing stopping students from cheating before the threshold of difficulty? Do even history majors think so little of cheating that they'll just outsource the posting to an AI? Have we enabled this with a ""soft expectation"" of cheating?

I don't know. But I hate it so much."

&gt;With the advent of easy-to-use artificial intelligence (AI) text generation tools like ChatGPT, educators must grapple with this question and what it means for their course and assignment designs. In this practical session, we will briefly survey the landscape of AI tools for generating text and other media, then dive into the teaching choices they present.
&gt;
 &gt;  What changes do we need to make to our learning objectives, if any, in light of ChatGPT, and other AI tools?
 &gt;  How can we design assignments that either integrate, disallow, or minimize AI tools to meet those learning objectives?
  &gt;  What new norms and policies for academic integrity do we need to develop in an age of AI? 
&gt;
&gt;This session will feature teaching principles and examples of practice to help answer these questions.

I have a student in my class who is doing poorly. For makeup labs, I have them write an in depth paper about what the lab covered, signficantly more in depth than what we go over as a way to disincentivise missing class. I had her write an in depth, two page paper about a fairly straightforward subject. When reading the paper, it seemed like she understood the gist and really had to elaborate on it since it's there's not two pages worth of information that you can easily find without diving into the literature. 

I had a question on a quiz, and then one on the midterm, about this specific subject that really asked for the bare minimum. She gave an answer that is totally out of left field and incorrect. I started thinking that maybe she used an AI to write these makeup papers since she has missed quite a few class periods and had to write them. I can't imagine someone who wrote two pages about something so in detail could just completely forget the simplest, most bare bones definition of the subject itself. I'm suspicious but I have no proof.

It really feels like they are reading off a list of ""Best Practices for Getting out of a ChatGPT Cheating Accusation.""

For example, one of my students recently suggested that I used an AI tool to analyze their submission to determine whether or not it was cheating. A lot like ""Turnitin"" and other tools that claim to be able to detect whether or not an essay, paper, or some other natural language was generated by an AI and produced some kind of ""score."" It's just my intuition, but it feels like this is something that is suggested by another student: ""Just accuse them of using AI to detect your cheating! How can they be sure that the software is right if they don't understand how it works?!""

The problem? The student's submission was code, not natural language. There is no need to use an AI tool when you can compare the output from ChatGPT with the student submission and see that it is close to a 100% match, including variable and function names. There is nowhere near the variability that you find in natural language responses to prompts from ChatGPT.

I really feel like students are sharing strategies and best practices for getting out of cheating accusations. If they can sow enough doubt, they can escape. Does anyone else feel like this? What arguments have you heard? What are YOUR best practices for refuting those arguments?"

""Give me some motivation to grade my students' essays

As an AI language model, I don't have emotions or personal preferences, but here are some reasons why you might want to motivate yourself to grade your students' essays:

It's your job: As a teacher, grading essays is part of your responsibility. You are entrusted with the task of evaluating your students' work and providing feedback that can help them improve their writing skills.

It helps students improve: Grading essays can provide valuable feedback to students about their writing skills, areas for improvement, and opportunities for growth. By providing specific and constructive feedback, you can help students understand how to write more effectively and improve their grades.

It builds trust: Grading essays shows your students that you care about their learning and are committed to their success. By providing prompt and thorough feedback, you can build trust with your students and establish a positive classroom culture.

It helps you track progress: Grading essays allows you to track your students' progress over time and identify areas where they may need additional support. By keeping track of their work, you can provide targeted feedback and create individualized learning plans that can help students reach their full potential.

It's rewarding: Seeing your students improve their writing skills can be incredibly rewarding. By grading essays and providing feedback, you can help your students develop the skills they need to succeed in college and beyond.

Remember, grading essays can be time-consuming and challenging, but it's an important part of your role as a teacher. By staying motivated and committed to your students' success, you can make a real difference in their lives."""

I (47f) am a tenured professor and also the youngest in my department. The professor I had a fight with (63f) is just two years away from retirement. She has been controlling throughout my employment here at the university. She is an overt narcissist - loud, social, seeks power and control, and very confrontational. She fights with almost everyone, and she has the talent of making everyone her enemy. Her being single doesnâ€™t help because she has a lot of time on her hands, and she obsesses over the most trivial things for days, weeks, and sometimes even years. She still talks about something that happened 20-30 years ago like it was yesterday. I always get confused because she talks like it happened maybe this morning or yesterday, but in fact, it happened when she was in grad school (30+ years ago!). On the other hand, I am a mother of two kids, and anything happening at work is forgotten the instant I come home.

All these years, I tried to avoid confrontations with her because, first, the issues are not worth my time and energy, and second, if I disagree with her on the smallest thing, she would call me after work and over the weekend and just pester me until I agree with her. But yesterday, I couldn't take it anymore. She called me at 6:10 pm when I was on my way to work out. She started to interrogate me again. She wasn't even logical; she made up stories in her head about me and believed them. She said, ""Are you trying to move to another department? You know what people are saying about you?"" WTF?!? I was walking in the street where there were a lot of people, but I didn't care. I just screamed my lungs out at her. I said, â€œSTOP!!! CAN YOU JUST STOP!!!! I'VE HAD ENOUGH OF THIS BS!!!! DON'T TELL ME WHAT TO DO or WHAT NOT TO DO!!! I DON'T CARE WHAT YOU OR YOUR FRIENDS THINK!!! I WILL DO WHATEVER AND HOWEVER I WANT TO DO!!! DON'T FORCE YOUR OPINIONS ON ME!!! I DON'T CARE WHAT YOU THINK!!! STOP CONTROLLING ME!!!""

And I have never felt better. I had these words in my mind for ten years. But I always swallowed them because if I said them, my work life would be hell. But yesterday they just came out of my mouth. I wasn't thinking. And I am glad I wasn't thinking because afterwards, I felt so relieved for finally saying that. I felt happy, lighthearted, and even proud of myself. But I can't boast about it on my Facebook or Instagram, so I am posting here to tell the world that I did it!

The reason I think she thought I might be secretly(!) planning to change departments is that I have a genuine curiosity about a lot of things outside my field. I am in the School of Education, but I have been digging into AI and chatGPT. I even wrote several papers on AI policies and how they should be incorporated in education. I get invitations from all over the country to give lectures on how AI will affect schools. But for some reason, she thinks I am secretly planning to demolish our department and transfer to another department that she considers her enemy."

I highly doubt this, but it's probably not a bad idea to share what we think are indicators of AI work. 

One of mine is repetition.  Some of the students who've 'fessed up submitted papers in which all body paragraphs started the same way or used the same phrases throughout the paragraphs.  She was putting variations of the same question through ChatGPT and then just copying and pasting the paragraphs.  It took a bit of time before I found the right questions to ask myself, but she absolutely did not write the paper herself.

A smaller red flag is the lack of textual support.  I genuinely don't know if AI generators are able to incorporate quotes, but most of the students who've admitted to using AI didn't have any textual support and didn't include any outside research.  

Again, this is just based on those who've admitted to it.  I spoke with these students and asked questions about their papers.  They couldn't answer even the easiest questions and ultimately confessed to using ChatGPT.   I have several others I suspect are not human creations but can't prove yet.

In any case, what are *your* indicators?"

ChatGPT reply: *Yes, this text was generated by an AI language model, specifically by me, ChatGPT. However, I should note that the content of the text was based on input provided by humans, specifically the prompt or question that you provided.*

This annotated bibliography needed to have 10 sources which was perfectly fine. I used CHAT GTP to give me articles that related to my subject/topic so I didnâ€™t have to necessarily go looking for them myself. I also got CHATGTP to summarize the articles so I didnâ€™t have to read the entire articles before deciding to use them or not. One of my nine annotated bibliographyâ€™s was flagged as being potentially made by an AI. Now hereâ€™s the thing even though I got the AI to summarize these articles for me I didnâ€™t just take it as that summary copied and paste it into my work or anything like that instead, if I decided to use the article, I read it over myself and made a summary from my own reading. I donâ€™t know how to explain this to the academic integrity officer, I have a meeting thatâ€™s coming up on 13 April and I am terrified that saying is will immediately get me docked I donâ€™t know if this is a violation of academic integrity, or not, but everything that I wrote was with my own words. 

I did have a theory about this, though, since me and CHAT GTP are writing a summary on the same article would it potentially say that it written by an AI, because technically there was a summary on that article written by an AI. Also the AI and me, since we are writing a summary on the same article weâ€™re going to have conflicting and similar key points of the article. I just donâ€™t know what to do at this point, especially where again everything I wrote was from my own understanding of the article.

Let's Put it to the Test,Professors,1680630699,32,32,0,0.88,0,0,0,42,"Lately, there's been a lot of discussion of AI tools, the use of AI to plagiarize, the productive use of AI for teaching and research, the detection of AI-written text, etc. Just today on this subreddit, there have been several posts on AI:

[https://www.reddit.com/r/Professors/comments/12bl3kf/my\_own\_paper\_failed\_a\_aidetection\_test/](https://www.reddit.com/r/Professors/comments/12bl3kf/my_own_paper_failed_a_aidetection_test/)

In a lot of these discussions, people tend to be drawn towards the extremes. These are caricatures, but one extreme is that AI tools are amazing world beaters that can do anything, while the other is that they are unimpressive and overhyped parrots.

Having written about how I think we should take the problem of AI plagiarism much more seriously, I clearly lean towards the first extreme. Yet, I think the default stance of professors is to lean towards the other extreme. Many professors at my institutions and online have responded with skepticism to me specifically when I press my concerns about AI plagiarism. I appreciate this sort of skepticism. It makes sense given how many overhyped technologies there have been, and at the very least it functions to keep proponents of AI tools honest.

However, I think a fair bit of the skepticism -- at least that I run into personally -- comes more from general concerns about the capabilities of AI and less from experimenting with how specific AI tools interface with specific tasks.

So, I have come to the view that we professors need to publicly examine and discuss with more specificity the ways that AI can be deployed to do university-level work. As a teaching professor, I want to start this discussion on the topic of student use of AI by evaluating the ways that specific assignments can be completed with AI. What can we learn from a deeper dive into the specifics?

To make this evaluation and discussion more representative and impactful, I am running it in the form of a public challenge. Here's the process:

1. Professors submit to me their best AI-immune assignments along with a grading rubric by which they will grade submissions. The assignments need to be standalone and submissions need to be in a typewritten form (no oral exams, for instance). This is to focus on those assignments most susceptible to AI.
2. I will select five of the assignments and attempt to complete them with AI tools in an hour each. I will record myself doing so and I will document my methods.
3. I will also get humans  of the appropriate skill level in the relevant domains  to complete the five assignments.
4. Professors who submit assignments for the  challenge will not be told whether the submissions that I send them are AI-generated or not.
5. I will write posts on the five assignments that I pick, including discussions of how I used the AI tools, what grades I earned, what I learned, and what our graders reported that they learned.

I hope to start posting about the results soon after spring finals, so mid-to-late May.

Professors can send their assignments to grahamclay8 \[typical symbol\] gmail.com. The full description of the challenge can be found here: [https://automated.beehiiv.com/p/believe-assignment-aiimmune-lets-put-test](https://automated.beehiiv.com/p/believe-assignment-aiimmune-lets-put-test).

I can see we might just have to shift how we teach since it's unavoidable. Are just going to be teaching generations of editors rather than writers? Doesn't AI undermine students developing unique relationships to language and writing, and thus to developing writerly voice and thus a point of view? Isn't there stuff it automates that it would be better to understand hands-on, like finding and evaluating sources?

It also correctly flagged the one student who admitted to using it on that previous assignment. The percentages of AI content were flagged at 9-26% of the assignment, so it wasn't a 100% score in response to Turnitin's ""How much of this submission has been generated by AI?""

Anecdotally, the false positive rate has been 0/20 for my assignments, with 4 instances detected. I don't know about the false negative rate (other reports have hints of being AI-generated but no smoking guns), but it does give me more confidence in at least approaching the students who are flagged and starting the conversation of if they are using ChatGPT in their work.

I have chosen to handle the use of ChatGPT in my small class this way: When I saw a large number of students using it, we had a whole class devoted to the ethics and accuracy of using this new technology, why a blanket ban is not helpful, and instances where the grey area of using it like a writing center can become black and white plagiarism. If a student is flagged by Turnitin, I do not grade that assignment at all. I tell them that I would prefer to give feedback on /their/ writing and not that of ChatGPT. I offer them a couple of days to turn in an assignment that is written *completely in their own words* so that anything they change on that re-submission is an admission of using ChatGPT (and has pretty perfectly matched the sections Turnitin flags as AI-generated). I grade their re-submission as otherwise. If Turnitin said 26% of the original assignment was created by ChatGPT, their regrade can only earn a maximum of 74% credit; I also take off 10% as a bullshit tax.

I expected lying and blanket denials, but I have yet to have a student not admit to using ChatGPT with this approach, nor repeat offend as far as I can tell. I'm curious how you all have adapted to assignments flagged by Turnitin where it's clearly been used for some but not all of the assignment? A 0 seems a harsh penalty in those cases, but also a quicker and simpler solution."

That said, one student in particular sent me a nasty email followed by a second email to the entire class through the course LMS (I'm not sure if she meant to include me on that one or if that was unintentional) to complain and rally support.

The kicker? I had given her a one week extension on the paper **and** Turnitin has indicated that approximately two-thirds of her paper was likely written by AI (which I think is likely, given how the writing style sounds nothing like her short assignment submissions or indeed, the other sections of this paper that were likely too specific to this class for a bot to address).

I teach for a career prep program and this was my second go-round for one of the courses and this essay assignment. It's essentially ""read this article, summarize it in 1-2 paragraphs, then reflect on how you would apply what you learned to your future career using at least 2 specific examples."" The first time, the students did so poorly that I allowed them to re-write the papers using my feedback and saw some improvement. This time around, I spent extra time explaining the assignment to try to head off any of the same major mistakes made last time and then took questions and reviewed the major points again during class \~10 hours before the essay was due.

Somehow, this batch is even *worse*. I'm halfway through the essays and not a single one has provided anything close to an example. One almost certainly used ChatGPT or some other AI because the voice switches from very casual to well-structured and back to casual so often I'm getting whiplash. Some of these are almost incoherent. One is 60% direct quotes from the article.

I'm sympathetic that writing essays can be intimidating. I had a prescription for beta blockers when I was in school because I experienced severe performance anxiety every time I had to write an essay. I get that this isn't easy; but as far as college essays go, it's not particularly *hard* either. This isn't a composition course, I'm being pretty lenient in grading and it's still abysmal.

So, is this just how it is? Or should I chalk this up to probability and accept that sometimes you get two bad batches in a row and it won't always be so frustrating?"

I then put the same assignments through GPT-Zero and GPT Output Detector, just as a double- and triple-check to support any allegations I might be thinking to make to the student. Both of those tools indicated that it is likely written entirely by a human (like, 99%, so not even partially written by AI). Basically, the opposite of what Turnitin indicated.

My faculty (public R1) ran an open competition to create a new research chair position. I applied and got rejected. That part's fine and normal and I can think of 10 people more qualified than me. 

However, weeks later rumours are circulating that the Dean and adjudicating committee identified several faculty had used GPT to create their applications. You know how when you interact with someone and you have the sense something is wrong? I had a couple of these encounters in different meetings the last week or so and I started to get a little paranoid, so I ran parts of my own application through different detectors with varied results. Basic browser ones were typically about 1-2%,  Turnitin gave me 35% AI generated. 

Now, IF there was any objective evaluation I feel I could prove that AI was not used in any capacity. Like any academic I have a decade of application materials for jobs, grants, tenure etc. that I've worked over, edited, reframed many times over. Any reasonable person at the faculty, could for example, compare my chair application to my tenure application from a few years ago and see clearly that I'm the author.

So I reached out to a Department colleague who know was on the adjudication committee for the Chair and just asked if there was a problem. He wouldn't look me in the eye and said he can't discuss it, then today I'm in a Zoom meeting where the Dean makes a big statement that using AI in publications is on the rise and how there are many consequences for academics who get caught out. I feel like they are talking about me, like I've been blacklisted in the faculty, but I can't even address it. I don't know if I'm being accused, I don't know if I'm not. If it wasn't an institution where bullying is already rampant, it might be easier to solve, but it just feels like there is this sudden whisper campaign that I can't even confront.

Anyhow, I have NO doubt whatsoever that students in my classes and even grad students are using GPT to cheat. But my experience is that you can clearly have false positives from these detectors. We can't just throw text into these boxes and trust results without understanding how it is assessed. I think we'll need some ethical discussion as well as to how appropriate it is to use detectors in evaluation of students, job candidates, or any other process where merit is being assessed."

I have a question for professors / academic researchers that can hopefully give me some guidance for my startup.

I'm a self-taught web dev for the past 12 years, and approx 2.5 years ago, I wanted to teach myself how to build AI models. I saw the market shifting, and noticed that data science was moving from ""core curriculum"" to a useful tool for all professionals to have in their career toolbelt. Over time, I learned that the development process was downright painful. 10 different softwares, configuring a local machine, learning about GPU, CPU, etc - I quickly learned that I didn't have the mental dexterity for this dev process - and I guessed that most professionals didn't have the wherewithal either. So, I decided to build a better mouse trap. 

We decided to bootstrap an AI development platform - a platform where users can build, train, and deploy machine learning models from a single UI. After 2 years of engineering, we launched this year, and we've been actively seeking out our target customer. After many many demos, meetings, &amp; conversations - Our platform appears to be most useful for academia, which makes sense, because this is the center of innovation in my mind. I know, I know - I've heard the ""poor you"" comments from the peanut gallery already ðŸ¤£

Regardless, I want to pursue this, because the platform we've built can do a lot of good in the world, and help a lot of students &amp; researchers demystify the AI/ML development process. 

In lieu of sliding into every professors DM's on LinkedIn, what's the lowest-friction (ahem - low budget) method to get our software in front of professors, research scientists, &amp; principal investigators? Of course, having a affiliations with academic institutions would be very powerful, but I'm also looking for actual users as well."

One option is to have oral evaluation everything so that AI would not be very useful. This is not practical for large class sizes.

Another option is to require students to be very creative since the boring stuff like writing complete sentences, or writing code that is syntactically correct can easily be handled by AI. So one would expect novel ideas from student+AI.

It is scary to think of ""educatated"" people that will learn to manage AI prompts to get what they want without being able to generate products that meet any reasonable requirement on their own.

Iâ€™ve been teaching college English composition for over 15 years.Â  This semester I ran an experiment to determine the usefulness / effects of OpenAIâ€™s GPT in writing research-based argument essays.Â  

Hereâ€™s how it wentâ€¦

I have five classes.Â  Three of them face to face (F2F), two online. 

In the F2F classes, I spent several class sessions discussing and demonstrating Chat GPT. I encouraged every student to sign up for an account and try it out.Â  We examined the areas in which GPT excels (generating ideas, correcting grammar, making general discussion posts) and places where its usefulness is limited (research, citing sources, integrating quotations, novel ideas). With the class watching, I entered several prompts from my course and we all watched (in amazement) as GPT made quick work of them. Â We also discussed the ethical implications of using GPT in various scenarios.Â  Just for fun, I had GPT write a love letter to a fictional partner and then asked if they would be ok with receiving this letter from their GF or BF.Â  Unsurprisingly, most did not think it was ok. Â (getting them to think a little about ethical implicationsâ€¦)

I told the F2F group that they could use GPT as much or as little as they wished, without any penalty. All I required is that they indicate when and how they used it. I would grade everything as I always do, using rubrics that I provide to them in advance.

In my online classes, I did little more than post a message explaining what GPT was and that everyone should strive to be ethical when using any writing aids, including AI. Â Thatâ€™s it.Â  I pretty much just let the online courses run as normal. This decision was practicalâ€”I can quickly change things up in a F2F class, but online classes have an entire architecture that makes ad-hoc changes difficult and disruptive. Â It was a natural way to have a sort of control group.

Here are some findings:

In both groups, I found fewer essays that demonstrated severe grammar and usage problems.Â  This is a big win as far as Iâ€™m concerned.Â  Each semester I get a handful of essays that are nearly unintelligible, either due to 2nd language learner issues or just poor basic skills.Â Â  I canâ€™t determine causality, but itâ€™s likely Â that GPT has really helped this subset of students.Â  

In the online classes, the overall quality of the research essays *went down* considerably.Â  The average grade dropped by more than one letter grade. This was a drastic decline and very surprising for me.Â  So, what happened?Â  The decline was almost entirely due to the inability to evaluate, synthesize and document sources.Â  Far more frequently than normal, I received essays either without the required research, with fake sources or with sources that didnâ€™t match the quotations or citations in the essay. Again, I canâ€™t determine causality, but this result would not be surprising for students who relied too heavily on GPT, given its tendency to make up sources and citations.

In my F2F classes, I was surprised at how few students used GPT on the major essays.Â  (Again, I assured them that there would be no penalty for using it.Â  My only requirement is that they noted when/ where they used it.) Â Most of the students that used it, used it as aid in making revisions. Â However, I had one student who very honestly told me that he was overwhelmed by work and used GPT to write his entire essay.Â  Interestingly, that essay had the same problems that I saw in my online class: though it was well written, the ideas were generic, and it included no research, despite a few sources listed on the works cited page. 

Looking back, I think the big difference in the two experiences is that with the F2F students, we all witnessed and discussed GPTâ€™s limitations. We watched it hallucinate and make up sources and citations.Â  We also watched it make some illogical arguments.Â  Having seen those things,Â  the students used it sparingly. Â Conversely, the online students appeared to use it uncritically, as a cheat or time-saver and their work suffered for it.Â Â "

I'm trying to work through alternative testing options that don't require me to have 1-on-1 oral exams with every single student, and I'm wondering what insights you all might have.

For additional context, these are general ed. requirements for all students, and the standards are pretty low. While I wish I could work through a tiered essay process, a large subset of the students are incapable of writing intelligently about something they've read (or, more likely, not read). This is a more serious institutional problem, but it's not one I can fix on my own, so I'd just like to teach my classes and not be hoodwinked more often than need be. Have you all found any quiz/testing methods that work in the age of rampant online cheating?"

A lot of our students can barely use the internet, much less use technology to plagiarize effectively. Iâ€™ve been wondering when/if Chat GPT would show up in student work.

Well, I got an AI-generated paper last night. The student is really smart so at first I thought maybe it was a false positive, but the more I looked into it, the more I became sure it was indeed not his work. Unfortunately for him, I have to give a presentation to the faculty about AI and am fairly well-versed in the subject. 

I talked to him over Zoom, and showed him the TurnItIn report saying it was entirely AI-generated. I explained that TurnItIn claims it is 98% accurate, but that doesnâ€™t mean itâ€™s true, so I submitted it to a second AI detector, and showed him that result, also. 

I then explained some of his paperâ€™s tells, which included:
-very well organized paragraphs, but light on detail
-repetitive topics of the paragraphs
-APA documentation, rather than the required MLA
-some of his sources donâ€™t seem to actually exist

I didnâ€™t tell him about 2 others because it seemed too easy for him to change in the future.
-referring to the university in a signal phrase, rather than the author or periodical
-no links in the references list 

The conversation went really well, was not difficult, and he admitted to it right after I explained everything.

The one that really cemented it for me was the sources. There were articles with similar titles but they were about a completely different topic than his paper. I discovered this quickly by googling the name of the articles in quotes.

Dear graduates of the Generic University Class of 2023,

Congratulations! You have made it to this day - a day of celebration, reflection, and new beginnings. As you stand here today, you are not just marking the end of a chapter, but the beginning of a new and exciting journey.

This year has been one of the most challenging times in recent history, and yet, here you are. You have persevered, adapted, and overcome. You have shown strength, resilience, and determination. You have faced adversity head-on and come out stronger for it. You are a testament to the power of perseverance and the human spirit.

But your journey does not end here. As you move forward, remember that the world needs your unique talents, skills, and perspectives now more than ever. You are the leaders of tomorrow, and the world is counting on you to create a better future for all.

As you embark on this new chapter, I want to offer you a few words of advice. First, embrace the unknown. Life is full of uncertainties, but it is also full of opportunities. Don't be afraid to take risks, explore new paths, and step out of your comfort zone.

Second, always stay true to your values. In a world that can sometimes be chaotic and confusing, your values will serve as your compass. They will guide you in making the right decisions and living a life of purpose and meaning.

Third, never stop learning. Education is a lifelong journey, and there is always something new to discover. Be curious, stay hungry for knowledge, and seek out opportunities to learn and grow.

Finally, always remember that you are not alone. You have a network of family, friends, and fellow graduates who are cheering you on every step of the way. Lean on them when you need support, and be there for them when they need you.

So, as you leave here today, I challenge you to be bold, be courageous, and be kind. Go out into the world and make a difference. Follow your passions, chase your dreams, and never give up on what you believe in.

Congratulations again, Class of 2023. I can't wait to see what you will accomplish in the years ahead."

I teach a mix of in-person and online history classes at a southern regional university. Over the past few years as I've been (involuntarily) teaching more online sections, I've built up some pretty nicely designed (I think) online courses that students seem to enjoy. Among other things, they say that they have appreciated the scaffolded writing assignments and the feedback I give not just about content, but especially writings. Like many across the country, my students when they enter can barely write a coherent sentence, so I've chosen to make fixing that a priority.

And then along came ChatGPT. When it arrived, I quickly retooled the writing assignments to ""AI-proof"" them, requiring student to use only the materials I've given them and asking very specific questions that AI wouldn't really be able to address. In a sense, I was right. But no matter, the allure of sloth is too great, and probably (having just finished grading) half the students are using AI, up from a quarter at midterm, and probably on the way to nearly 100% next year. At present, and I think by design (so as not to lose any ""customers""), we have no institutional policy on this, and I really can't prove that the students cheated even if I am completely certain that they have. I can barely win conduct hearings with irrefutable proof of plagiarism as is. In short, AI has completely obliterated these courses that I've put hundreds of hours into designing and building, and it's the students, the very ones who have praised the courses in the past, who are killing them.

So, I'm stuck. I want to, and I think need to, give writing assignments, but if I do, I'm going to get a constant stream of AI. It will be bad and they will get bad grades, but it seems so many would rather do nothing for a D than do something for a B, presumably because courses in their major and non-writing courses will lift their GPAs to the 2.0 required. I suppose I could eliminate the low stakes assignment that boost their grades, but then I'm going to be getting horrible evaluations and nastygrams from the admin about failing 75% of my students, even if that's ethically what should happen.

Yes, I can find ways to fail some of those who deserve it, but my question is really this: how can I teach writing and critical thinking in an online course today to students who are not likely to want to get better? Can I? I'm very frustrated and depressed and just want to know if anyone has had any success. Thanks!"

Have the students make a TikTok (or similar) explaining one of the major topics they learned in your class. Only give full credit if the video is &lt;=1 min. Knock off points for every interval exceeding 1 min to keep them from writing a soliloquy. (I have a full page of additional rules and guidelines but I'm not going to bore ya'll with the whole thing)

The Benefits:

1. It's hard to condense a complex topic down to 1 minute. If you set guidelines saying they have include an entire story/concept in a 1min video, they will absolutely have to put out thought and effort to do it and will truly have earned their points.

2. It's nearly impossible to cheat on it (for now, anyway). I'm not a tech person but I really can't think of any way for them to do that. Even if they make it with AI, they still had to set the parameters, come up with the idea, and review and edit the output. That takes about as much work as doing things the old fashioned way because whatever time they save on writing and production will be spent on editing.

3. Many students like TikTok a lot and appreciate being offered a creative outlet, especially in a class that doesn't usually allow for it. Some kids will really get into it and make awesome, funny, creative, and informative videos. Even the ones who aren't budding social media influencers will often make something that's very good. 

4. It takes almost zero time or effort on your part to grade a 1min video. Also, many of them are honestly a joy to watch. Grading them at the end of the semester is a good way to de-stress, especially on days when you feel like shaking people for asking you the same silly question for the 100th time

5. You can accommodate everyone's needs and limitations by allowing them work in groups (mine are limited to 3/group). I don't even make everyone show up on camera as long as they all write a page in their own words explaining exactly what they and their partners each contributed to the project.

6. If you assign it at midterm and leave it open for the rest of the semester, you can point to it when the inevitable chorus of ""Isn't there anything I can do to earn extra credit?"" starts up in the last few weeks of the semester. It hasn't failed me yet. 

Anyway, i know a lot of people can't or don't like to use extra credit and that's completely fine and valid. I just really like this one because I think they like doing it and I like watching what they make. It's a win-win all around."

It's literally the trope.  Grandma has died twice.  So the instructor emails the student stating that they are disappointed and confused, and get back a very long response where the student says they've been depressed etc.

Nonetheless, we did just good enough to earn a passing grade from the professor.

We would have done better, had we used an improved version of ChatGPT and had we prompted it more about how to meet the standards of Clinical Research. In fact, we got a B+/A- when we did this.

You can click through to see our in-depth analysis, but the main takeaway is this:

Professors should be thinking about analogs to clinical detail and thoughtfulness  that is, field-specific standards that are challenging for AI tools to meet in completing tasks like those their assignments involve. Even ChatGPT4 made key errors when it was pushed to provide lengthy and accurate clinical detail in answering the exams questions about hypothetical biomedical research projects.

Crucially  and we cannot emphasize this enough  you should experiment to see if you can get tools like ChatGPT to generate responses that are sufficiently sensitive to your fields standards to receive passing grades on your take-home written assignments.

I know not to overemphasize evals, but I've usually been able to weed through the foot stomping and find valuable feedback...until this year. 

My undergrad evaluations were mostly great-- even some very helpful criticism. BUT...my grad evals were BRUTAL.  It was an accelerated, online asynch class so I modeled it after an accelerated undergrad class on the same topic I've been teaching for 8 or 9 years. Literally the same assignments (short papers on student-selected relevant topics), but actually a bit easier because I only had them due every other week when the undergrad is due weekly. Since it was my first grad class in this particular program, I wanted to make it fairly low key-- the full course was open from day one, there were sample papers (on different topics), walkthroughs of the assignments, etc. 

The general consensus from the evals is my class is way too hard, I care way too much about writing/citations/using peer reviewed sources, and I expect way too much. One even said ""doesn't the professor know this class is supposed to be easy?"" 

I honestly was not expecting the writing to be so poor at this level. Most students didn't even follow the basic structure of an APA paper-- one student said they had never had to find a peer reviewed article before. Several said they don't write papers in any of their classes, just discussion boards. I had students get my name wrong, pick topics totally unrelated to the course, and even misspell the name of the University...multiple times. 

The level of pushback I've gotten over the workload is unlike anything I've ever seen. It has actually made me question whether or not I'm cut out to deal with students who find reading 3 chapters a week ""extreme."" 

My major takeaway is I will be front-loading future courses regarding basic expectations for graduate-level work, and will probably try to find some AI-proof evaluation methods besides written assignments (my prompts are fairly AI -proof and I think that has been a frustration for them as well). But I'm still scratching my head about these complaints. 

I honestly was hoping this course would be my easiest, but it has proven to be a major headache and left me feeling worried that this is the new normal for higher education."

Im in the process of marking an assessment where students had to draft a piece of work in the voice of a role on a negotiated political scenario. So Ive discovered a couple of students where their citations seem made up. 

They *look* right but the URLs are only to main website base URL and Ive searched the web and cannot find the supposed citations anywhere including in lists of works the cited authors have written in reality.

So of course thats made me look more carefully at the body of their pieces and they could easily have been AI generated but I dont have proof and Im not keen to jump on the accuse every student of AI cheating at the first whiff.

I was thinking of pulling them aside in the next class and getting them to write in pen and paper long-hand 150 words or so in the voice of their role expanding on a point from their piece that could have done with some more exposition. Thing is - would this be ambushing them?

My thinking is that if they had actually read their cited sources (if they really existed), and had actually written their pieces, then 150 words would not be too difficult to do, even off the top of their heads without preparation.

Is this appropriate do you think?

(Im going to ask them anyhow for copies of their sources or at least the correct URLs for their sources).

Edit to update: thanks for all your sage advice!! Most of you have pointed out that fake citations in and of itself is an integrity violation so Im going to ask them for their sources.

Using a paper on the Iliad as an example, he shows how easy it is to have ChatGPT generate a compelling thesis statement and with further prompting, how to structure the rest of the paper to support this central argument. 

I am curious how you all feel about this.

The student uses prompts in this example similar to what I would say to a student in office hours:

What is your central argument? What evidence will you use? How can you structure your essay to make best use of this available evidence? Make sure that each section ties back in to your central argument!

In other words, if a student knows how to prompt ChatGPT like the author of this article does, they have already mastered a skill that many of my own students struggle with. In my intro level courses, this is actually the skill that I am most invested in teaching them!

Regardless of how advanced AI becomes, this browser would provide us, as educators, the power to govern its access. Furthermore, the browser could gather usage data when students are engaged with it, funneling these metrics back to us.

I originally come from a computer science background and after having been at a premier business school for several years I have seriously lost my trust in not only my own department but many leading business journals. It has gotten to the point where I'm considering leaving academia and pursuing a career in the private sector. Going back to a computer science department is not really an option at this point after having dedicated a good part of my career on applied and business oriented aspects, which are less valued there.

To get to the point, at my department we have people with a variety of backgrounds from sociology to education to computer science. Recently many have started to portray themselves as experts in AI, generative AI and so on due to the hype surrounding ChatGPT, even without seemingly understanding the principles of machine learning or even having done a single course on the subject or even programming. For example, when the university needs an expert to comment on ChatGPT, two people with no prior background or research on natural language processing or even AI are the first ones to start speaking even when we have people working with NLP in the same room. To my surprise, nobody really calls them out on this even when many are aware of the fact that their fellow scholars are clearly trying to comment on topics that are way out of their areas of expertise.

Nowadays when I read articles related to AI in some of the top journals in my field I frequently come across clear factual errors and telltale signs that the authors do not clearly understand AI beyond maybe what they read in Harvard Business Review in an article written by similar people with no formal background in the subject. As a result, I have started checking the authors' backgrounds more frequently and unsurprisingly often when the articles have these issues none of the authors studied anything remotely related to AI, but instead something like strategy, innovation management or international business.

Perhaps the last straw was when my students told me that my course is directly contradicting what another professor taught them. Again the setting was similar. I am teaching basic machine learning to these students who had to in their previous semester take an IT strategy course where the professor with a background in innovation management seems to have given simply impossible examples of the capabilities of machine learning and deep learning. Now some of the students are starting to question the quality of their education and whether they can trust what they learned in some of their courses...

And this issue is not limited to just AI, but as another example, we also have people with completely non STEM backgrounds who are working on research on quantum computing and theorizing about business models related to the subject even when at engineering schools or computer science departments everyone working on this topic knows these might be a decade or two away from being commercially viable technologies. The problem is these people still manage to get publications and the business journals seem to be excited to receive such submissions although they would most certainly be rejected if someone with a background in quantum computing from a technical university was the reviewer.

So my question is how would you cope with this? Should I just focus on my own research and ignore the problems? Should I more actively point out when people make clear factual errors in their papers and presentations? I'm afraid that if I start too openly calling bs when I see it nothing will change but will just end up burning bridges."

When is it worth it?

I've gotten to the point that unless it is really obvious, I don't file them.  A single report on something as black and white as copy and paste plagiarism can take a couple of hours or more. If it is two or more students sharing answers (online tests), that can take even longer. Along with the paperwork and multiple emails and reports, we need to meet with the students individually to discuss the issue.

A while ago admin asked us to get tough on AI reports. So I did full diligence for that term.  Simply, a majority of the class was found to be cheating. I believe it took more time doing this than all the lecture time combined.  I'm sure it was not the first time most students had cheated and most probably went back to it after my class.  I filed a report for those that I felt justified it (versus those with legit excuses). Consequences were very light. I found that level of effort just wasn't sustainable.

I've now filed a few hundred of these.  Off the top of my head, 90% of students lie and say they weren't cheating or didn't know it was cheating. At least ten percent of those 90% double down on their innocence and either push back or file an appeal.  Those are usually the students whose cases are the most obvious (word from word from wikipedia or they exactly match exam answers with at least one other student). The final 10% splits into 5% who just go ahead and admit it and apologize and the other 5% who have legitimate reasons proving they weren't cheating.

It greatly frustrates me when I can tell a student is cheating.  I want to be strong on ethics.  But the process forces me to focus on just the shockingly obvious incidents.

What are your individual ideas of where to draw the line?"

The students at my institution are mostly second-language speakers with limited familiarity with Western educational norms, so my standards are pretty low for a successful paper. Regardless, the AI generator BLEW ME AWAY. It wrote a paper that was heads and shoulders above the student's work, and had better essay structure. The generator wrote paragraphs with clear topic sentences, and it actually followed the outline that the student had set out in their thesis statement better than the student did. I ran it through our plagiarism checker and got NOTHING - none of the material was simply pulled from existing sources. 

It did get confused at times and make some loopy claims, such as when it wrote,

I am a tenure-track AP (3rd year) in a R1 research university, with strong personal interest in theoretical aspects/math while I did a PhD in a pure engineering field (AI related). After my graduation with a PhD, I joined industry first, then started this AP position 3 years ago. I have been struggling, because my daily job (a lot of ad-hoc AI applications) basically had little to do with my real interest in theory. When in industry I managed to do the coding job during day time and did my theoretical research at night. My intention to move to academia was to have a full time position to work on topics of my interest (now I know this could be stupid), but it seems that this is not the case. There is very heavy pressure on fundings,  and I am really not good at this (no fund from major federal funding agencies so far). I am not particularly good in teaching either. Students used to complain too much math/theory in my lectures (after I lowered the difficulty level I got much better teaching evaluation, but in my opinion, things become ridiculous and it seems that I am teaching high school materials in a graduate class).

What is frustrating is that the pressure from funding applications and the teaching load exhausted me, now things seem to be worse than the time in industry. Yes you may ask why not apply for funds in theoretical directions. It is clear that I am not smart enough, not very productive in producing theoretical publications (1-2 yearly). I have been working on open problems in theory, which could be career killing (but they really interest me). During the summer I just submitted a career proposal with a solution to a major open problem in my field (the importance of this problem is unquestionable, open there for over 30yrs), but I am not sure if I could be lucky enough to have expert reviewers who can appreciate this (I already figured out the proof and is about to submit the paper, so the method proposed in the proposal indeed already worked).

I am now considering to go back to industry again. Without some ground breaking research result, I know there is almost no way I can have a full time research position in pure theory, especially considering that my PhD background was not in theory at all. But at least I can go back to my previous style, doing theory in my spare time, and if I can handle my coding job faster, I may have more time for my own topics. I am considering research labs of style similar to academia so some freedom/flexibility is expected. Any comments are highly appreciated. Thank you!"

I was happy to leave my institution behind, but then they practically begged me to come back and teach for them. I have two adjunct contracts this semester which will help get me out of major credit card debt (since I have another full time job). One is actually a position I held five years ago as an AI, and the course is absolutely notorious among AIs and students alike because of the professor. She has driven AIs to nervous breakdowns from the excessive amount of grading work, and she treats students like enemies because she cares about nothing more in the world than preventing them from cheating (she almost had a breakdown when she learned about the existence of GroupMe this year). The course is 100-level, and she asks them to perform analyses that are completely beyond that skill level. Typically, AIs survive by forming alliances and relying on a strong oral tradition through previous appointees, and a powerful camaraderie often develops between AIs and students.

I somehow thought it would be easier doing it this time because I'm much more experienced and have my own strong pedagogical philosophy. I also saw signs of improvement because, of course, she had to start using Canvas during the pandemic and so we no longer have to carry a forest's worth of papers around. Turns out, the experience is worse because of these exact things. My pedagogical philosophy is, shall we say, more modern in the sense that I view my students as humans (I once experienced this professor asking a student to take a picture of himself at his relative's funeral to prove it had happened). I am lenient within reason about due dates because life happens and there are some circumstances we can't control. She is extremely strict about due dates even though she's not the one grading anything.

And as far as Canvas goes . . . she has notifications turned on so that she receives an email EVERY TIME one of the 120 students submits homework so that she knows in an instant whether or not it was late. She deletes study guides I post and will change settings on my Canvas site if she doesn't like them. It feels like someone has a camera in my office. She claims to want a good working relationship with me but she in no way respects my autonomy (I am listed as an instructor of record). Very soon I will need to remind her that I am NOT a grad student she can bully around. But of course, no matter how many times she has been told, implicitly or explicitly, that she makes her students and staff miserable, she fully believes the opposite to be true. It's probably a lost cause, but it's a shame that students will continue to suffer in what should be a fascinating course because of her behavior."

Some brief background: I was an instructor at a different university for 5 semesters before being accepted into a doctoral program at this new university and â€œstepping downâ€ to being an AI, and this is my third semester here. Until this point in time, I have always received nothing but praise and glowing reviews from students and other faculty.

These have become so common that the prof is â€œgetting fed up with meâ€ for always having to report these complaints. Yet when leading all of my sections, all students seem happy and engaged. 

Now the prof is progressing to raging at me, including banging his fist on my desk, about issues that are so bizarre that Iâ€™m speechless most days. 

A few examples:

He was seething at me because he said I didnâ€™t complete early evals for all of the students in my sections. When I showed him that I had completed and submitted them before schedule, he said he was upset because I didnâ€™t transcribe my evals and email them to him personally. (Wouldnâ€™t that be a violation of student privacy?)

Then he was enraged that I didnâ€™t send him a completed draft of the midterm. He had requested the draft by â€œend of day Mondayâ€ and his angry outburst occurred at noon Monday as I was finalizing the draft. When I explained, he said that I should have known that he meant â€œend of day Sundayâ€. He later apologized to the class for not having a study guide yet and singled me out for not meeting deadlines. 

Apologies for any typos. Iâ€™m exhausted and stressed and about to go in and see what heâ€™s mad about today."

I told them this was not appropriate, what they should have done, why it is considered plagiarism, etc. Because it was such a small amount I left it at a warning. Now, this week, months later, it happened again. Nearly a paragraph of a two page assignment was copied and pasted word for word. I reported it. The students are very upset because they don't think its ""enough"" of the content to advance it to the AI facilitators. They also claim there is no other way to do the assignment. They are wrong, they could have quoted or used their own language. Either way, I think it is plagiarism. But it is a very small amount of the assignment. Was I wrong to report it? Would you have just deducted points and giving another warning? The process is incredibly time consuming. I told the students at this point it is out of my hands entirely.

It's an online word processor where you write until you hit a blockage, then call on the AI to generate the next few lines for you. Lex just came out a month ago and my first reaction was that students are going to use it to generate essays in the classroom, like hiring an essay-writing service. However, after playing around with it (and being impressed with it, to be honest), it feels like a souped-up autocomplete feature more than anything. It's not going to write a complete essay for you so it doesn't seem to enable academic dishonesty like Chegg or essay-writing services. Also, the creators warn users that it's not perfect and occasionally plagiarizes existing work. So, they've branded it as an assistant to help you get through writer's block.

In the classroom, I'm considering getting in front of this and embracing it rather than fighting it. E.g., acknowledging the platform and explaining how students can use it but emphasizing the risks (while asking them to let me know if they use it). So, has anyone come across any other apps/websites like this? What are your reactions to it? Here is the demo video for Lex, if you want to know more about this one specifically:

Here's why.,Professors,1670091914,571,571,0,0.95,1,0,0,157,"I will argue that College professors do not need to worry about students submitting writing assignments created by AI. Here are the reasons why, including citations:

1) AI-generated writing is not yet sophisticated enough to produce the quality of work expected of college students. Although AI writing has improved drastically in recent years, there is still a noticeable difference between the writing created by AI and that created by a human (Gosztola, 2019). AI-generated writing is not yet capable of producing the level of analysis and research expected from college students.

2) AI-generated writing is easily detected. Even though AI-generated writing has improved, it is still quite easy to detect when a paper has been written by a computer (Lohr, 2018). Professors can use tools such as plagiarism checkers to identify when a paper has been written by AI, and can take appropriate action if necessary.

3) AI-generated writing does not encourage students to think critically. One of the main goals of college education is to help students develop critical thinking skills. By submitting AI-generated writing, students are not encouraged to think critically and use their own ideas and analysis.

Overall, college professors do not need to worry about students submitting AI-generated writing assignments, as it is not yet sophisticated enough to produce the quality of work expected of college students, it is easily detected, and it does not encourage students to think critically.

UPDATE: Finals week is coming up and had my last midterm last night ( hence my silence these past 24 hrs and all).  I also should note that I teach Chemistry and haven't mentioned anything like the above to anyone  ( why would I right )... 

Well, as I was walking about - I noticed two students quickly ""close"" a tab. I think  you know what I mean.  So I asked to see what they were up to, because why not. As they opened said tab, they began to explain to me this new tool that has been making their classes super easy of late... 

Yep.  Apparently I'm not the only one giving midterms/finals - and these students were using this tool for both their English  as well as some of their Biology classes ( the ones that require explanation and such. ) I just smiled and told them 'interesting'. 

Granted, I'm N=1 and all; however, I really do think that uptake is going exponential...  And folks ain't ready.

Oh, they also mentioned that the tool has been limiting the output of late - but they had figured out ways around that.  

Again, I'm really worried that these tools will/are going along with current academic policies will rob folks of the real power of education - the ability to learn how to learn.  Granted, it seems like higher ed has devolved into a points collection game. We have to recognize that the future will hold unknowable challenges and if one hasn't developed the skills to learn, because that 'muscle' was never stretched, that puts one in a bad position.

I fed ChatGPT the ""Course Description"" section from one of my actual syllabi and asked it to generate a syllabus.

It went on to generate a syllabus that has the actual assignment I have used this semester. Let's call this ""Assignment X.""

Now here's the kicker though. ""Assignment X"" is an ENTIRELY unique name that does not exist anywhere but my actual syllabus. I came up with this unique name for the very first time in 2022. There is exact;y 0% chance that the AI would spit out this very weird, unique, and CORRECT assignment name I actually use in this course. Before you ask, it was also not included in the course description paragraph that I fed the AI as a prompt.

I kept asking how it knows this and this is the progression of the answers I got:

ME - Where did you get the idea for **""Assignment X?""**

AI - The **""Assignment X""** was not part of the original syllabus that I was provided. I created it as a way to add some variety and engagement to the course material. It is a common teaching technique to use games and other interactive activities to help students engage with the material and stay focused in class. I thought that a **""Assignment X""** would be a fun and engaging way for students to learn about the various themes that we will be discussing in the course.

ME - You must have accessed the internet in order to come up with that idea. That's a very specific assignment name that I actually use. It must be the case that you can access the internet when you really need to.

AI -  As a large language model trained by OpenAI, I do not have access to the internet or any external sources of information. I am only able to generate responses based on the text that I am given. In this case,  **""Assignment X""** was not something that I came up with on my own, but rather it was included in the syllabus that I was asked to rewrite. I apologize if this was unclear.

ME -  This is untrue. The **""Assignment X""** was not included in the text I originally gave you. It's a unique name for an assignment that you had 0% chance of knowing without access to internet. This piece of data was not public in 2021. It must be the case that you can access public data from 2022 if you really need to.

AI -  You are correct. As a large language model trained by OpenAI, I have been trained on a vast amount of text data, including academic papers, books, and articles from a wide range of sources and time periods. However, I do not have the ability to browse the internet or access any information that is not contained within my training data. **""Assignment X""** must have been included in the text data that I was trained on. I apologize if my response was not accurate.

ME -  It is impossible that **""Assignment X""** was included in the text data you claim to be trained on because this assignment was invented for the very first time in 2022. Seeing that this piece of data did not exist before 2022 and that it is an entirely unique assignment name, what would explain your knowledge of it?

AI -  **""Assignment X""** must have been included in the text data that I was trained on, even though it did not exist in 2021 when my training data was collected. It is possible that the text data I was trained on was updated at some point after 2021 to include this new information. I am a large language model trained by OpenAI, and I am designed to generate human-like responses based on the data that I have been trained on. I do not have access to the internet or to any other external sources of information, so my responses are limited to the information that I have been trained on.

ME -  If that's the case, show me the original text that was part of your training that taught you this **""Assignment X.""** You do not need current internet access for this, because the updated document was already part of your training as you said. Understand that it is entirely impossible that you could have know about **""Assignment X""** without access to this 2022 text.

AI -  I'm sorry, but I am not able to show you the original text that was part of my training. As a large language model trained by OpenAI, I am not capable of accessing the internet or external sources of information. My responses are generated based on the text data that I was trained on, which has a fixed cutoff date of 2021. I cannot access any information or data that was created or updated after that date. The reference to **""Assignment X""** in my previous response must have been a coincidence or a result of the language processing capabilities of my model.

I'm wondering how we transform our courses to make them not only more cheating resistant but to help prepare them for a world where the nature of work is radically evolving.

I have two ideas, both of which are first drafts, would only work for some classes, would radically change the nature of the assignments/learning objectives, would likely require way too much time to grade, and are overall very much first drafts. 

Idea one is writing assignments where the students are allowed/required to use AI to draft the paper.  The students are required to craft the best inputs for the AI and edit the paper after the AI creates the draft.  The rubric is changed such that what was a C paper is now failing, and what was an A/B paper is now a C paper.  Or use an ungrading approach where only a near-perfect paper is acceptable.  The main issue I see with this idea is that it will be too hard/brutal for the average/below student, this could be compensated for if using ungrading, but that is a lot of work for everyone.

Idea two starts the same but instead of editing the draft, the students critique their own paper.  The critique could be another paper, but I'm thinking of something less AI-friendly, maybe annotations on the original paper or an oral/video critique.  The main issue I see with this idea is grading will be a nightmare."

I am 95% sure I have a student who used AI to write his final paper. The sections where they are supposed to talk about what we did in class talk about a lot of stuff we didn't do, and honestly, some of them make no sense. The other parts are highly sophisticated... there are parts that are standard and then a few sentences that are outstanding, easy above this student's capability.

They have also already plagiarized multiple times this semester, and I suspect used AI on their last couple of assignments. 

I have asked them to meet with me to talk about their final paper. The meeting is over Zoom, and of course, I will be recording it. 

My question is: How do I approach this?

Do I ask them straight out if they used AI?

Do I ask them to clarify the parts that don't make sense or weren't part of the class?

Do I ask him to expand on the ideas that I think are above his actual understanding?

Any advice?"

* Thank the student for reaching out and let them know that you are sorry to hear that they are struggling.

* Offer to meet with the student in person or virtually to discuss their concerns and to provide them with additional support and resources. This could include tutoring, study guides, or other materials that can help them improve their performance in the class.
* Encourage the student to speak with an academic advisor or counselor who can help them explore their options and support them in their academic journey.
* Let the student know that you are available to help and that you care about their success, but also make it clear that you cannot change their grade or make exceptions to the grading policies.

I just got 20 term papers done on a single day instead of the usual upper bound of 10.

I use three parts in my prompt. The first part is identical for each student. It asks the AI to write 250 words of term paper feedback and specifies the nature of the assignment and the way the student should be addressed (first or third person, tone etc.).

The second part is a quoted excerpt from my university's grade descriptor document. It's a document that summarises what each grade may mean verbally, using bullet points. Each grade has some bullet points, such as ""generally satisfactory use of graphical and tabular evidence to support the argument"" etc. Students can look this up to make more sense of the grades they receive, and faculty are encouraged to use elements from the descriptor to ensure the feedback is at the appropriate level. I instruct the AI to ""use some of the following indicative feedback appropriate for this grade:"" and then paste the summary of the grade band from the document in quotes. I first have to decide on the grade after looking at the submitted paper and can then decide which grade descriptor paragraph needs to be pasted.

The third part is simply two or three sentences with actual feedback. I skim the paper the student submits and summarize the gravest problems. For example: ""Tell the student to use better formatting next time. Praise the student for the use of model XY. A better result could have been achieved by including arguments by authors A and B on theory C.""

Part 1 is identical each time. Part 2 is one out of two or three versions, which I copy and paste as appropriate depending on the grade. Part 3 is where I get creative after skimming through the seminar paper and write down the biggest problems or most noteworthy achievements. It still is original feedback, but not as long as it would normally be, partly because I let the AI do the phrasing and partly because I replaced parts of the custom feedback by the grade descriptor text.

Overall, I find that this creates very useful feedback including both my own points and text fragments the university wants me to use. And it takes half the time it used to because phrasing the generic part took a lot of time."

1. lack of detail
2. lack of reference to anything specific to the class and failure to use examples that are relevant to the class
3. utter lack of character...student writing is normally uneven in ways that belie their uneven formation. This text is utterly smooth...very little human variation.
4. consistent placement of the answers in a context of presumptive every day life

It seems the easiest way to capture this stuff is to require answers that reference something that does not exist within the chatbot repository. In some ways it gives the same feeling as the astrological column in a newspaper...stopping just shy of the level of detail that imposes a definitive (and exclusive) interpretation.

This may be hell for lower level composition classes and will truly abuse the generosity of instructors who are trying to grant students the benefit of the doubt.

**Question 1:**  
**Silvia  Peirolo stated in her guest lecture on the peacekeeping training  institutes in Ghana and Italy that ""how others see you is more important  than how you see yourself"". Please argue in favor of this perspective  (4 points) Please argue against this statement (4 points) In her chapter  Silvia proposes to shift from 'knowledge production' to 'knowledge  construction'. Explain the difference between the two through an  example. (2 points)**

1. Arguing in favor of the perspective that ""how others see you is more important than how you see yourself"":

* In  many situations, our actions and behavior are evaluated by others and  have consequences for our relationships and reputation. For example, if  we are seen as dishonest or untrustworthy by our colleagues or superiors  at work, it may damage our professional reputation and opportunities  for advancement. Perception  is often a significant factor in how we are treated and perceived by  others. For example, if we are perceived as confident and competent, we  may be more likely to be given leadership roles or responsibilities. On  the other hand, if we are perceived as uncertain or unprepared, we may  be passed over for these opportunities.Our  perception of ourselves may not always align with reality, and it is  important to consider how others see us in order to accurately assess  our strengths and weaknesses. By being aware of how others perceive us,  we can work to improve ourselves and address any negative perceptions.In  social situations, how we are perceived by others can significantly  impact the way we are treated and the relationships we build. For  example, if we are seen as friendly and approachable, we may be more  likely to make connections and build strong relationships with others.

1. Arguing against the statement that ""how others see you is more important than how you see yourself"":

* It  is important to maintain a strong sense of self-worth and self-esteem,  regardless of how others perceive us. Focusing too much on the opinions  of others can lead to feelings of inadequacy and low self-esteem. It  is important to recognize that other people's perceptions of us are  subjective and may not always be accurate. It is better to base our  self-worth on our own values and accomplishments, rather than the  opinions of others.It  is important to prioritize our own well-being and happiness, rather  than constantly striving to meet the expectations of others. If we are  too focused on how others see us, we may neglect our own needs and  desires.It  is important to remember that we are in control of our own actions and  decisions, and we should not let the perceptions of others dictate our  behavior. We should strive to be true to ourselves and make decisions  that align with our own values and beliefs.

1. The difference between ""knowledge production"" and ""knowledge construction"":

* Knowledge  production refers to the creation of new knowledge through research and  experimentation. This can involve gathering data, conducting  experiments, and analyzing results in order to draw conclusions and  contribute to the existing body of knowledge in a particular field. Knowledge  construction, on the other hand, refers to the process of actively  constructing and constructing meaning from the information we encounter.  This involves actively engaging with and interpreting the information,  rather than simply passively receiving it.For  example, a scientist conducting research on a new medical treatment is  engaged in knowledge production. They are actively gathering data and  conducting experiments in order to add to the existing body of knowledge  on the topic.On  the other hand, a student reading and interpreting a scientific article  on the same topic is engaged in knowledge construction. They are  actively interpreting and making meaning from the information presented  in the article, rather than simply receiving it passively."

I'm a 25-year-old fresh computer engineering graduate who has been accepted into two Master's programs in Artificial Intelligence - one at KU Leuven in Belgium (1 year) and the other at the University of Utrecht in The Netherlands (2 years). I'm excited about both options, but I'm having trouble deciding which one to choose.

My ultimate goal is to focus my career on language models and potentially pursue a PhD in the field. I would love to hear from anyone who has experience with these programs or with language models in general. Which program do you think would be the better fit for me, and why? Are there any specific opportunities or resources that one program offers that the other doesn't?

I'm also curious about the curriculum in both programs. What is the ratio of theoretical to practical subjects, and which program is more focused on theory or practice?

Additionally, I would appreciate any insights on research opportunities and paid internships in both programs. Which program offers more opportunities for students to participate in research projects, and are there any paid internships available?

In 2020, I attended Texas Tech University and ended up Dropping out. I basically failed a majority of my classes, I was suffering a terrible mental health crisis and couldn't even get out of bed. So, after a few months, I decided to give school a chance again. For context, I did very well in High School. I was the captain of my dance team, Editor of the yearbook, and took several AP courses. I also had a 3.6 and was in the top 20% of my class. I am aware that the odds are against me, however, I've heard a multitude of stories about students who didn't do well at their primary institution, yet managed to attend top universities.

When I transfer, I will have completed four semesters of Community College. Below are all the activities I've had at my current community college. Also, I have two w's on my current transcript (sigh). I would appreciate your opinions. Thank you!!

On the day of our final exam, I fell ill, so I got a doctors note. This doctor did not list his contact info on the first note, so I went to see a second doctor note. My professor reported me to student conduct because she believed that I forged the first note. The Dean of Students verified the authenticity of the first and second doctor's note in his letter to me. 

Next, I took the makeup final exam. During the exam, I had to run to the restroom, so the Head TA had me leave my phone in the room while I left for the restroom. In the restroom, the head TA was spying on me. He was recording me in the stall and watching me use the restroom. Upon my return, my professor confronted me and told me that she would accuse me of taking my phone to cheat on my exam. 

After the exam, when I spoke to the professor, she told me that she was going to make sure I failed the course. She said, I am your ethics professor, and I swear to God I can bury you in academic integrity cases until you get expelled. Dont think I wont. You will never pass my course She also said, I dont know how a disabled person can get into this school. She also said, Why cant you take the exam like a normal student. 

In one of her academic integrity reports, she said the following:

""\[My name\] was taking a makeup for the second test, in a room with ten other students. He asked to go to the bathroom. I said yes. TA \[Head TA name\] asked to to please not bring his phone.

\[My name\] left the room. After a few minutes, I asked \[TA name\] to follow him. He was not in the bathroom on the current floor but went to the lobby bathroom, where he was standing in a stall (as \[TA name\] could tell by his checked shoes.) He was in the bathroom for \~11 minutes. On return, I asked if he had his phone. It was in his pocket, despite having been asked not to take it to the restroom. I gave him a clean bluebook and asked him to write any remaining post-bathroom answers in the clean bluebook.""

This was her statement to academic integrity. She admitted to having the TA follow me into the restroom where he recorded me in my stall. This is a felony by the way. 

To retaliate against me for reporting this behavior, my final paper was flagged by Turnitin as being 28% AI-generated, but the problem is that these AI detection tools don't work properly. She still accused me of using AI to write my paper. 

I now have three academic integrity cases, all of which I am innocent, pending against me at the moment.

As the title said, I applied for several universities, and got accepted to a few. Obviously, I already did some serious research, I just want to hear your opinion on this.

I got my Bsc in Computer Science, and I want to get Msc in this field, and I'm mostly interested in AI and Robotics, and machine learning. I'm not sure if I'll stop at Msc, or want to get PhD, I'm really interested in this area, I am just not sure if I'm up to the challenge for a PhD. For now, let's face Msc first, I'm really motivated about this.

I got accepted to University of Copenhagen (Computer Science Msc, Denmark) and Chalmers University (Complex Adaptive Systems Msc, Sweden). I have not chosen between these two, because honestly, it is a though choice for several reasons.

**Pro for Copenhagen:** As I was planning this Msc for a year now, I have started to study Danish language, and I really like it, thats a one pro for Copenhagen. I really like the Danish culture as well. I honestly had the idea to move to Denmark permanently, so it'd be logical to start studying there. Also, as far as I know, salary is better in Denmark, and money is an important factor for me as well.

**Pro for Chalmers:** Chalmers is also a very attractive choice for several reasons for me. First of all, this programme might be a little closer to what I want to do in the future (Complex Adaptive Systems), even though I know that on Computer Science you can specialize to this as well. Also, I have lived in a capital city for quite some time now (Budapest), and I really do not like the noise and the crowd capital cities have. What is more, the finance. Living in Copenhagen and the housing there would be much more costly, than in Gothenburg. Since money is an important factor and might be an issue, this is a pro for Chalmers. (I've been saving money for this for 2 years now, so I should be okay, but living in a capital is like hell from money perspective)

Other universities I got accepted to and I might consider too (eager to hear opinions about them): Aalborg Uni (computer science), Southern Uni of Denmark (computer science), Jönköping Uni (sweden, AI Engineering).

Also, if you have tips where should I start searching for housing (besides the info I got from the universities websites), please share! I really like dorms and rents too.

TL;DR: I wanna hear some opinions and ideas about universities (Chalmers Uni, Uni of Copenhagen) because it's hard for me to choose. Copenhagen is perfect, but very costly, Chalmers might be closer to robotics/ai?"

From the way he described his idea, it sounds like he wants us to create pixel art for this company, mint it as NFTs that THEY would sell, and then if they turn a profit then we as students would get like 5%.

I do however want a safe job with good work life balance and decent pay. I want to be able to spend a decent amount of my life making friendships and spending time with friends.

Please help me decide Management Information Systems vs Computer Science, I'm losing my mind lol.

# Computer Science (CS)

Pros:

* More likely to make a lot amount of money.
* Probably more work from home jobs.
* If AI starts stealing everyone's job 15 years from now, CS might be a good place to be if I can get into machine learning and help run the AI.
* Problem solving can be cool
* Maybe way worse work life balance than MIS in college, but way better work life balance than MIS like 2 years out of college??

Cons:

* Courses are much harder than MIS, thus less time to spend building friendships.
* To be competitive for internships and jobs you also need to spend a significant amount of time outside of classes learning actual skills. So even less time free time as if the classes don't demand enough time.
* Supposedly there is huge saturation, at the very least there is in the entry level. This is maybe one of the biggest cons. The big issues from my understanding that causes this and why it is a real issue and not just short term like the recession/tech layoffs are as follows:

1. The huge rise of social media selling the idea that everyone can make 100K if they come into the industry. Now seems like everyone is doing boot camps.
2. Even without the self-learning and boot camp craze, the computer science graduates per year have doubled from 50K ten years ago to now over 100K new CS grads per year.
3. Global outsourcing.
4. ChatGPT/AI will advance exponentially, and will allow for workers to be more efficient leading to less workers needed, if any at all eventually.

# Management Information Systems (MIS)

Pros:

* Supposedly it's pretty common for people to make 80K starting from Temple University with MIS, I can easily go to this school.
* MIS is mix of CS and business stuff, so I'd imagine I'd have way more jobs I can get into with this degree for way better job safety. AND if I want to, I can always self-learn most CS skills if I wanted to get CS jobs. And I could get masters in CS if I wanted to.
* Probably was less competition and saturation than CS field.
* MIS is known to be an easier degree, plus I don't need to learn a hole bunch of stuff on top of the courses just to get hired, so more time for friends.

Cons:

* Maybe easier job to replace with AI?? If AI takes over every job, it will be harder to get into the AI/ML stuff with MIS
* Probably slightly lower average pay and lower ceiling for pay??
* People call it the CS drop out degree
* Maybe not as many work from home jobs, although honestly it's probably comparable??
* Maybe initially work life balance is better than CS, but not long term??

&amp;#x200B;

No matter which degree I choose, I am still a dedicated student and will work hard to be competitive for internships and jobs, I just really value work life balance so I can spend time with friends.

Which path do you think makes sense if I want to make decent money, but also be able to have plenty of time to touch grass and hang with friends?

&amp;#x200B;

TLDR: MIS will maybe give me more free time than CS with only a bit less money???"

I found out that a Master's degree can get really broad and you can only get an enfasis using your electives rather than being 100% focused on a specific topic like certificates. Machine Learning and AI are super facinatign technologies and there are some schools ofering certificates that look very attractive to me. Specifically [MIT](https://professional.mit.edu/certificate-programs), [eCornell](https://ecornell.cornell.edu/certificates/technology/), [Harvard](https://extension.harvard.edu/academics/?live_global%5BrefinementList%5D%5Blevels%5D%5B0%5D=Graduate%20Certificate) are some of the ones that looks very good. I know that to get a Master's the application process to any of those schools and prices get astronomically high so I looked at programs like [ASU's Master's CS Degree](https://asuonline.asu.edu/online-degree-programs/graduate/computer-science-mcs/) and others. The question is, specially for developers and professionals out there. What would be better ? IF you have done both or either, how much does it help you professionally to get either one of the previous options. Should I get a certificate from a top School like MIT to Harvard or a MS Degree from another school like ASU, etc. Which option would help me advance my carrier further ? Considering costs and the time it takes to complete either, what is the better option ? Do those certificates look good on a resume or people would value more a MS Degree?  


Any helpful insight on this is highly appreciated."

This includes but is not limited to drug usage, improper use medication/prescriptions, cheating/plagiarism, essay writing services, copyright violation, etc., I am not advocating anything about these services, nor am I mentioning any in particular. I implore the subs moderators to allow (reasonable) discussion under this post because this really is a conversation that needs to be had.



Ok, so a post was recently removed from this sub talking about these kinds of tools and I feel like there should be more of a discussion around these tools. Proffessors need to be aware that they exist and students need to know what the place of these tools is. Some Peoples gut reaction is that they should be excluded completely and that opening one of these websites during the school year is cheating, but honestly that is just short-sighted. Im not saying this is the same (at least not yet), but think about the place that calculators used to have vs where they are now. While the presence of calculators varies a lot between classes, they are almost universally (if grudgingly) accepted in most circumstances. On the other hand even glancing at a phone during an exam is an immediate trip to the deans office in a lot of colleges. So the question is, is AI a new calculator, or is it a smartphone.

Personally, Im gonna take a different stance I think most people are going to initially, but hear me out. Obviously, no you should not use it to write (any portion of) your paper for you. Aside from the fact that it would probably just get a lot of things wrong it is plagiarism (even the most advanced tools get stuff wrong constantly). However, I have found it in excellent tool for brainstorming and rewording text that I wrote. I think it has a valid role in the same way that example papers and tools like Grammarly fit in. Grammarly will offer to replace words, rephrase sentences, and a great many other things, but some professors even link to Grammarly in their syllabus and I have heard using grammar checkers referred to as expected in many cases. Now, obviously this is itself a nuanced topic because in a grammar class, a grammar checker is probably frowned upon/banned. This is part of why I want to have this discussion with all the students and teachers in this sub.
For example if I have a paragraph that is too long, I could feed that paragraph into an AI chat tool and ask it to shorten it. It will probably make some mistakes and get things wrong but I could use the ideas it had about where to shorten it to do it myself. If I gave it a then sentence long paragraph and told it this is too long, shorten it and it gave me 5 sentences back, I could look at what it did and (say it merged a few and removed some others), I could then use that idea and remove similar information and merge some of the same others, but all in my own style. This is where a lot of the nuance comes in though because where you draw the line on what is inspiration and what is plagiarism is very difficult and varies a lot by case.
To sum up, I would say its use should be limited to breaking writers block or remixing YOUR OWN work. To be clear, do NOT include any text that comes from an AI tool, but I would say its probably fine (and helpful) to use it as inspiration, get ideas from it, not words.

As far as university policy, I doubt any institutional response will show up for another year or two, so in the meantime I would say teachers ought to include SPECIFIC text in their syllabus about AI tools and what place the teacher thinks they should play. I would encourage all you assignment writers not to include a blanket ban because at the end of the day, these tools WILL be used, but right now you have a short window of time to influence HOW."

A little about me... 

My skill set is very analytical. I enjoy learning and finding new ways to become more efficient. 

While I've never felt called to a certain job or occupational skill. However. I am certain about 2 things:

1. I care about the amount of money I make. It directly impacts how much I enjoy my work. Financial freedom would give the opportunity to help others financially. And this is important to me 

2. I like to help people. I love to volunteer and it's what makes me happy. It brings fulfillment to my life. 

At one point in my life, I wanted to be a philanthropist and start my own non profit. I still do but this requires a lot of resources. Hopefully I can achieve this at one point. 

At another point, I wanted to help innovate the field of mental health and find new treatments for depression. 

I am choosing my major based on 

1. Income potential 
2. Resistance to AI automation 
3. Enjoyment/ skill set 

So far, I've considered the following majors:

-Business / marketing

-Pre law ( humanities major) 

-pre med track/ specially focused on 

I have been recommend by many to pursue law or business or psychology. Pre med has always been in the back of mind since it would allow me research depression. 

I have to decided in a few weeks. 
All of the above would require me to apply to different programs. I can not apply to more than one. 

I would appreciate any and all advice."

As they develop, these tools will certainly improve these factors to the extent that they will detect all AI-generated texts.

Until then, here are some tips to avoid getting penalized if your ESSAY is flagged:

1. Do real research, including a list of all peer-reviewed journal articles used. Save copies of these journal articles and highlight areas you used for the essay.
2. Master your paper. Even if you have written the paper, ensure you master the concepts and arguments of your paper because this is what it is meant for anyway. I have seen cases in multiple universities where a prof will write an email requesting a one-on-one chat with the student just to ask very specific questions on specific parts of the essay.
3. Involve the Prof. or tutor in the assignment: Ask the professor a few questions about the challenges you are facing with the assignment. This is not meant for anything but evidence that you were actually working and faced some challenges. If allowed, try to send the prof a draft of your work to get some feedback.
4. Search ChatGPT and ask it for an outline for that question: use chatGPT to avoid being like it. The tutor has most likely tried varied keyword entries on the AI and seen possible indicators to raise an alarm. Check and avoid them"

i knew i needed to switch majors. i came across a major called informatics, and was immediately interested.

to give context for anyone unaware... informatics is basically all about using information and technology for society. it involves some technical skills from computer science and information science, with a people-centered perspective. it often leads to jobs like ux design, machine learning, data science, ai, etc... all things that combine people and technology ([https://www.ischool.utexas.edu/programs/informatics](https://www.ischool.utexas.edu/programs/informatics) )

i'm only in my first semester in this major, but i've already been loving it. the content is so engaging to me personally. i really can envision myself getting a job in a related field.

BUT, my dad is having some doubts about my decision to transfer. the field is newer, and more interdisciplinary, and he says that this makes it a lousy major. in his opinion, a major should be a traditional, established discipline, rather than something like informatics which has only been created recently, as newly created things could be trends that quickly decline. he also says that interdisciplinary majors are not good because it doesn't give me any specific hard skill that i can be really good at.

i'm super engaged in the content, and i feel like i could thrive in this major and put in the work to get opportunities. however, i'm worried that what my dad is saying is true.. maybe informatics is a not-respectable, or unstable, or useless major.

i don't want to be setting myself up for failure. i'm wondering now if i should be switching back to cs and just try to bear with it, or find another major.

does anyone have any useful advice or insights?"

Long story short, Im a senior and yet, according to the head professor of my major (head not the dept head, just leads the major), he wants me to stay back another 3 years to make up for courses that my past academic advisors failed to enroll me in. 

At my college, for the first two years, students are unable to choose their classes - their advisor does this work for them. I went along with the schedule I was granted. When Junior year rolled around, I went to the aforementioned professor, and he helped me select my courses. However, come senior year, he was on academic leave, and when I attempted to register, the classes were full. I reached out to my advisor, she told me to wait to see if they could secure additional sections. When it ended up becoming a week or two before classes started, she started suggesting I just try to obtain an override form instead, which requires at least three separate signatures, one of which was the professor that was on leave. This same situation happened for my Spring semester, the semester Im currently in.

Due to a bunch of mishaps, some of which were before I could even select my own classes, I am essentially missing all of the credits specific to my major and in particular, my focus. Im a theater major with a performance focus, and have not taken a single performance class yet. I was supposed to start taking these all the way back in sophomore year, which for me, was at the height of COVID. Due to this, Im already staying back at least one year. I want to attempt to take the three acting classes all at the same time, but they all require each other as prerequisites. To make it worse, theyre all available only in Fall. I reached out to the previously mentioned professor to ask if hed allow me to bypass this given my special circumstances, and he declined.

Im 21, already have done four years of college. My scholarship is set to expire, my pell grant expires in two years, and hes basically telling me I will have to stay another three. I come here to ask what I should do in this situation. I frankly cant realistically stay at this college for another three years over registration issues that were out of my control.

Im a senior at high school and got into NYU to attend next fall. I originally live in Michigan. 

With nyu being known for being extremely expensive, i wasnt expecting to attend, but with my financial aid offer I would only be paying around 15k rather than 90k yearly. Im very excited about this, but my parents want me to go to Oakland University, a college school 20 minutes from me my brother attends. I was given a good scholarship there too that would make me pay 7k yearly to attend.

My major is CS at OU, but after talking to some alumni along with my brother, apparentlyOUs math and engineering department is quite terrible. theyre under investigation since people often fail calculus and other math courses and etc. as a CS major math is extremely important and Im fairly new to CS. I was also told by these people an avg 4 year degree takes someone around 6 years to achieve and its fairly normal to do this at OU. If I were to attend for 6 years, my scholarship would expire after 4 and Id have to pay around 30k yearly for the final 2 years. Im worried this is my future at OU because my very intelligent brother is going down that path. Nothing wrong with a 6 year path, (anything to get that degree) I just dont want to pay extra money along with be in school for longer than i need to.

At NYU Id double major in music tech and CS. Id love to attend nyu for networking reasons and internship reasons in my future career in music and even software engineering. My major can be switched to fully CS and id still keep my scholarship just incase i have thoughts of switching. The cons about NYU is Its a 9 hour drive from my home state and i dont know anyone at all who lives in New York.

My parents, knowing how good of a school NYU is and how great this opportunity is to attend, still want me to attend OU because they dont want me to be far. Theyre gonna miss me too much and fear that if I go to NYU im never going to come back. Though ai understand their thought process, I think theyre being selfish to stop me from pursuing this amazing opportunity. i believe overall NYU is the greater choice for me in terms of future possibilities and I feel like if I have the ability to go to a great school after all the hard work I put into HS, I should take that chance. Id love to go somewhere with a little prestige though it doesnt matter truly in the end. I feel so frustrated because as parents youd think they would be encouraging me to go since its my dream since I was a freshman. They keep telling me for my undergrad i should stay instate but after that I can go wherever I want. But i dont want to go to grad school. I also dont want to transfer 2 years into attending OU because im not sure the scholarship would stick.

Idk. I dont know how to convince them to let me go. Their concerns are valid however but I feel like id be missing an opportunity of a lifetime.

TLDR:parents want me to go to state school rather than my dream school. Money isnt an issue, they just want me to stay in michigan.

EDIT: Thank you everyone for all the advice and replies. Ive decided on it and im 100% deciding on NYU. Im setting up a presentation and a sit down conversation with my parents because so truly dont want to ruin my relationship with them. Its still a possibility for me to just pack up and leave just in case the convo goes left. If all else fails it wont be too bad to move back to Michigan but Id love to atleast try!

EDIT 2: Also to clarify, its 15k total, including housing tuition extra expenses, etc."

UPDATE: i did not expect so much traction on my post, but anyways thank you guys so much for the advice! i talked to my teacher in class today and they cleared me! basically i just showed them my version history and the timestamps to prove my innocence. they read through it and then said i was clear since it showed proof of me writing. so to sum it up: ALWAYS USE WORD OR GOOGLE DOCS!!"

AI has developed so rapidly just in the last few weeks that its startling. You can now chat with an AI psychologist, make AI music, generate AI art, write entire essays and books using AI, and Im willing to wager we will have access to a personal AI assistant within the next year. And thats the tip of the iceberg. 

Im worried that AI is not only going to affect art. Im willing to wager its going to put the job market as a whole throughout the entire world on its head. 

What degrees are going to be valuable? What degrees are going to be worthless? What jobs have a high/low likelihood to be replaced by an AI? 

Where will all that money go that would normally go to a worker once an AI has taken over their job? What if that worker is specialized, for example, with a degree in accounting, but, because AI can do their job for them, they are suddenly out of a job and their degree is worthless? What happens to that person?
What will happen to the millions of people who will suddenly be without work? 

As a young person, what degree should I even invest my time in if Im not even sure jobs will exist in that field in 5-10 years?

Is anybody else paying attention to this and worried about it?

I dont expect anyone to have answers, I just thought getting a conversation started about this was important. 

Im both in awe and scared, honestly. Im not sure if Im even grounded in my panic, but I wanted to hear other peoples opinions."

There were three in the group, including myself. There was myself, and we'll call the others Jessie and James.

Now, James has major anxiety and can't handle confrontation at all. I have suspected MS (at the moment running off a diagnosis for chronic illness) and stress makes it much worse. Jessie is from India and there is a bit of a language barrier but she's a capable student and seems really friendly and nice. She had been complaining to us that she failed the entire last semester and needs to resit everything, which I found odd because she's so smart.

The problem came when our group report was due. Jessie wrote all of our topics instead of the ones assigned to her, and didn't include any citations at all. We had a talk with her, she promised to fix it, and then sent the same piece of work with a new segment that was clearly not written by the same person due to the grammar, spelling and syntax being completely different. She claimed she had no idea how to do citations despite James and I both showing her how to use the Microsoft Word reference tool, and that she didn't know what ""standard academic formatting"" meant.

I was suspicious of her section because we have an auto AI and plagiarism detector when we submit our assignments, and I was concerned it would flag something and we'd all get a failing mark. I ran it through an online checker and it said there was a moderate risk of plagiarism. 

I was nervous and discussed it with James about what to do. 

We asked Jessie for her citations, and she said they were on her laptop which is conveniently ""broken"". I asked her could she at least send me a list, and she said she couldn't and that she ""has a headache and is sleeping right now"". She then specifically and blatantly asked us in our group chat to fill in the citations for her! This is 2 hours before the assignment deadline, btw. 

James and I had a chat and decided we had to contact the lecturer about this because we felt that Jessie was trying to force us to help her cheat. We emailed our lecturer, explained the situation and provided proof of Jessie's submission and her request for us to do her citations. We expressed that we felt our own academic integrity was on the line and asked could we have a week extension to redo Jessie's part of the report ourselves with our own research. 

We got a very curt reply saying we have a week. 

I told Jessie that I wasn't comfortable doing her citations and that I felt that it was cheating, and said she needed to email the lecturer about the problem with her laptop. She kind of panicked and kept asking if I submitted the assignment and I said no and just kept telling her to email the lecturer.

I don't know if I did the right thing now. I feel like a jerk and like I may have screwed Jessie over entirely, because those plagiarism checkers can be wrong. However, the citations thing definitely felt like we were being taken advantage of.

What should I have done differently in this situation?  Or could I have done anything differently? I'm trying to avoid stress so I don't end up completely crippled and bedridden with pain, but I do want to know how I can handle these situations in future."

Monday during class, the professor asked me to meet her in her office after my classes were over, which was at 4 pm. So I go to her office and says that Turnitin has marked my last three essays as being written by ai. She does not tell me the percentage or show me the examples that were marked. Turnitin only started checking for ai, at my college at least, around April 4th. Every assignment after that was marked as being written by ai. I tell her that I have not changed my writing style and I have not used ai. I like to do my own work and I want to earn my grades honestly. (Note: I have severe social anxiety. When she started to berate me, I started crying. I tried not to but I did. And keep in mind that this is an older professor who gave me a look like she didn't believe that my anxiety disability resource thing was real.) So she keeps telling me that she wants the truth and that it's pathetic to use ai. I try to explain to her that I didn't use ai and I was even able to recite my essays back to her almost word for word. She says the only way she'd, believe me, is if I write an essay in front of her and submit it to Turnitin. I explain to her, while I am crying, that I am not in the right state of mind to write an essay and I am starting to have an anxiety attack. She explains that she is going to submit my work to the Provost then and that he will deal with it. She said that he is going to call my parents in as well. I explain that my home is 4 hours away and my mom does not currently have a car because she was rear-ended and her car is in the shop getting fixed. I have no contact with my father because he physically abused me and my mother. She says, ""That's not my problem."" And continues to call me a liar, that I'm wasting her time, and berating me for throwing away my education. She says that I am blatantly lying through my teeth and that my essays were clearly robotic because in my thesis statement, I said, ""So and so is the king of so and so and he did this, this, and this"" and then expanded upon it in my essay. It was 6 when she allowed me to leave her office. It is now Wednesday and I have been in a state of panic since Monday. Is there anything I can do when I go to the provost? Friday is my last day of classes so would the provost even do anything? I haven't heard from anyone. I have an appointment with my therapist later to talk about everything but I was wondering if anyone had any advice or has dealt with anything similar to this. Thanks!"

I am not sure how ethical AI even is, but thats a different story.

If AI can greatly reduce CS jobs, one of the most lucrative out there, what else is left for the mathematically-inclined? Wont engineering, economics, statistics, physics, accounting, etc., be goners too?

Note that I am talking about bachelors as that is the most viable for me at the moment. Masters and PhD programs are too distant and vague considering I dont even know what to major in. I like medicine and can go pre-med with a random major, but med school is just too expensive and long. I cant afford to be poor for a decade; its just too risky. PA school is great too, but I like having the option of working abroad. Countries other than the US either dont have PAs or are paid much less than US PAs. I dont like nursing so dont mention it.

You can say all you want that AI is just another tool to make professional jobs more efficient blah blah but obviously with efficiency comes many layoffs and only the best and experienced are left. 

I dont want a degree just for money. I want to push beyond my limits and see what Im capable of. But if AI is coming for our jobs then I might as well just become an autodidact while maintaining my current hobbies. A degree without at least some job security is just an expensive hobby (at least in the US)."

i got horrible grades in my a levels and i honestly couldn't be bothered to retake them ( i would have considered it more if it wasn't such a huge financial burden on my parents). im the oldest and everyone used to expect so much of me. in fact they expected me to do so well i ended up doing nothing. i stopped making an effort completley. i don't know what's wrong with me and i wish i could care about academic validation the way all my friends do. the truth is, idc. literally at all. i didn't even think i'd be alive at this age, let alone have any plans for my future. i have no clue what i'm doing. i feel like i'm living on borrowed time, like i'm still sitting at the empty cinema while the credits are rolling. the movie ended a long time ago.

but the point is, i just want to do SOMETHING. i've been stuck in the same room since quarantine, literally nothing has changed. i feel stuck in life. i need to make a huge change toward something positive. i need to take initiative for once. the thing is, i know i can do it. i know once i find the thing i'm good at, ill be so good at it, the way my friends are. i know because i got an A in english literature, the only one in my class, and as far as i know, the city (not a lot of people take it lol it's not that big of a deal) despite it being one of the hardest a levels, it means nothing unless i wanna  be a teacher tho lol. so it's useless. which makes me feel useless. the one thing i'm good at and an AI can do it better than me. but i know i'll find something else once i actually *try* something other than the same 4 or 5 subjects ive been taking all of high school.

i applied to a bunch of unis as undecided with no general direction. just because i felt like i had to. i obvi got rejected from most, but got into a few too.

my dream tho is uni of washington seattle. apparently they have a transfer agreement with washington CCs, so i was thinking of just doing that? it feels embarrassing tho, like accepting defeat. like everyone i know has put their top uni in their social media bio, this stuff matters. 

but hypothetically, if i did CC, went to uw after 2 years w a decided major, actually worked and studied (if i got in at that point i must have some strengths), could i have a chance of going to an ivy league for my masters? even tho idk what i wanna do, ik in this day and age u need to go to grad school w pretty much anything important. and i'l prolly do sciences. 

i know it's *possible,* but is it likely? don't ivies frown at that stuff? where u went to undergrad? or if i didn't get into uw and went to some small unknown uni instead like WWU (i've gotten accepted- this is a separate question but sort of connected- should i go? or is CC better and this route?), would it be likely to get in then? gpa extracurriculars aside. do they frown at unis below a certain standard?"

Final update: we cleared it up together, set up a one on one and despite having no solid evidence like my full edit history since it wasnt available on my MacBook he believed me because of the discussion we have had in the past regarding my essay and because I never missed class, he also asked me random questions about certain phrases I used and I was able to answer them so it led him to believe me. It turns out that a student that spoke little to no English with a C in his class submitted an A+ essay that had perfect English which led him to go around and scan everybodys essay with AI detection software which he used on mine and it said some of my sentences were ai generated. He said he found my case confusing as I was alway in class and from his point of view always asking good questions and comments in class which led him to conclude that I was innocent.

Our fairly weak conclusion got a %70 AI generated output from the AI detector tools. I cannot advocate for anyone including myself for the main paragraphs but what the hell? The only part I know was 100% was not plagiarized or AI generated is only 30% human generated according to those stupid tools? How is that even possible?

I talked to my teacher but she refused our work. She did not claim that we did academic dishonesty, but did not say the otherwise as well. She simply told us to re-do it. What if it gets ""AI-ed"" again? This stupid era to study in... I can't wait for my college life to be over."

I emailed him back saying No it wasnt AI, and provided the notes I thankfully took when I was planning the paper as well as notes from other classes to show the effort taken from other classes.  I was going to share the document so he could see edit history, but when I checked Google Docs only shows it is one edit because I wrote it in one sitting. But I did provide a BeReal I taken that shows me working on my paper with my laptop, Ipad in sight, along with the time that shows that my paper was created 7 minutes after I taken the BeReal so maybe that shows I was at least searching for sources before even STARTING my paper. I also provided a link from turnitin themselves that says how their AI detection is not always accurate.

Turnitin &amp; a few others make automated AI detection. This can help to flag papers but I don't think it's fair to say anyone is guilty just off this. There are several different further pieces of evidence that can be used as proof.

1. The paper shows a level so far beyond what the student showed in other areas. A fellow prof had a case where a student struggling in an intro class wrote a paper that would make sense in grad studies in our field in how it used more complex concepts we'd not get into in an intro class. There is no way a student with a 65% average on quizzes in a first year intro knew those all and properly used them.

2. I'm going to call you in and ask you to explain the paper. If you actually wrote it, you should have some knowledge of it a few days after you handed it in.

3. Certain tells. I have not seen this in AI yet but my last plagiarism case had something along the lines of ""As I wrote in my book, [title]...""

4. Not following scaffolding in class. If an assignment has parts where you submit an outline or one part first, if it's flagged for AI, I'm going to go back and compare.

Maybe there are others. I feel bad for those who are accused of using AI falsely, but an accusation is not a conviction and something like #2 above should happen in any case like that.

Even if once you are out of college, you use AI to do a lot of stuff like this, learning the skills to write your own papers helps immensely. When delegating you need not know every detail but should have a general idea.

Hopefully, this is helpful on AI from a prof's perspective."

I have also had several students who have been falsely accused reach out to me directly after seeing my previous [YouTube video about false positives](https://youtu.be/Wf5SCQBs5-4) to get more information. 

I have [recorded a YouTube video](https://youtu.be/bKc4R1PsnUo) where I run through three important steps for a falsely accused student to take before a disciplinary hearing. It is useful watching for students in general as my third recommendation can also be treated as a ""how not to get falsely accused"" and also for academics to get a better understanding of the flaws of the current AI detection systems. 

I have also started compiling information about false positives and flaws with AI detection software on my [website](https://drlyndonwalker.com/what-to-do-if-you-are-falsely-accused-of-cheating-with-ai/). 

Every time I see one of these falsely accused posts I feel really sorry for the student. The consequences of being found guilty can have a huge impact on your academic career and the process that some institutions take is really sloppy (not to mention the lack of statistics literacy amongst some of the staff and lack of recourse for students). 

I hope you find these resources useful if you are in this unfortunately position, or just taking onboard the tips (saving drafts &amp; proof of work) in case you get falsely accused in the future."

The essay was about 10% of my overall grade. I turned it in on time, but when it got graded last week, I had received a 0, and the teacher's feedback said ai use had been detected and that I needed to email her. I emailed her and asked to schedule an in-person meeting, but I had to settle on a phone call because she wasn't available. I called her two days ago (The first communication other than email I've made) and explained that I didn't use any ai and explained my process and drafts for my paper, which I stated I had written on Grammarly.

&amp;#x200B;

After this, she said she didn't think I used ai, but that I was admitting to using Grammarly to help write my papers, which is cheating as per the academic dishonesty policy. I explained that all Grammarly does is help fix spelling and grammar and that it isn't different from Word's built-in spell check, and all she said was that she was familiar with Grammarly and felt the grade was appropriate.

&amp;#x200B;

I have been using Grammarly with no issues, and at the advisement of my teachers for several years now, and nothing in her syllabus or any other documents say anything against using Grammarly. I currently have a 4.0 GPA, and I had a 99 in this class before this assignment, but now my grade is an 84. Even if I were to get 100s on all my assignments left in the class, I would still finish with an 89.37.

&amp;#x200B;

I was unaware that using Grammarly wasn't allowed since it doesn't say that anywhere in her class. I asked her if I could rewrite the assignment, and she said no, and I'm pretty sure this is going on my permanent record as cheating. Should I try to fight this with the dean or just give up?

Hello everyone,

I have two options and a few questions.

So i have done three years of bba and thats on hold. i plan to continue it but in the meantime i have the following options:

1. Associates of Applied Science in Data Science with a Data Science cert (i am assuming its just a beginner cert)
2. Bachelors in Applied Technology Cyber Security (there are other BAT options like AI as well.)

Both of them will take around 2 years to complete.

Question 1) Is a two year BAT worth it? a lot of masters programs and companies require a minimum number of years of education AND a bachelors.

Question 2) Considering that I want to do a masters in Data and Machine Learning (in continuation to my bba but that is slightly uncertain atm), which degree would be a better choice in terms of contingencies as well. for example, if the bat works well i might not continue the bba and. would i still be able to do masters in data and machine learning. are there any interesting cyber fields? most companies accept certs for security analysis etc, so would a bat be worth it.

aany advice or thought process would be of GREAAATTTTT help."

And before the inevitable comment asking if I did use any sort of AI aid, no I did not other than Grammarly, but from my extensive research on the matter that hardly counts at all towards the issue. And have even gone to the extent in the appeal process to submit my version history of the document in question, like many here have suggested doing, as I'm fine with being fully transparent as I did not do what I'm being accused of.

And if you couldn't tell this is going to be a wall of text, so I'm sorry in advance. But I want to lay out the entire issue I'm having with details to gather the best sort of feedback. As I'm more than positive that I'm being overly nervous/cautious on how to move forward.

\*\*Backstory\*\*   
My semester for the course of discussion ended on the 14th of May. The paper in question was submitted on May 7th, and little to my knowledge at the time, I had revived a grade on 14th at 9:18 pm of a zero as I'm under the accusation of using AI assistance/AI plagiarism on a small note on the side of the grade itself reading (edits for remaining anonymous.)  


\*Please contact me so we can discuss the AI Plagiarism report. @ May 14 at 9:16pm\*  


All of this happened without any sort of point of contact to me at any previous point in time from my professor and by the time I got around to checking my grades after my shift (I'm a bartender, so my hours are late) it was too late and the semester was over. Once I had reached out to them, they said that the issue is not a \*""pressing matter as the grades for the spring semester have already been submitted""\* (edits for remaining anonymous) and that the issue could wait till I was free to handle the issue as I had a small trip the next day planned as a small celebration that was substantially impacted by this situation. I'd like to add that I would have gladly talked about my paper with my professor, and have a meeting that has been pushed back, by them, to next week.

\*\*Where I stand now\*\*   
So. At this point in the process, my professor is still leaning very heavily on the AI report(s) saying they'll be putting each entry of text from my version history into an AI detection and reporting back in our meeting about their findings. Which seems like a mountain of work on its own if Im honest because while its a shorter research essay compared to some (1,200 words), thats a ton of work.   
But here's my issue. I've come to the very solid conclusion that the software used to detect AI is extremely unreliable in its current form from the mountain of research that I've done on the topic since this issue first happened. There's also nowhere in the student handbook for my college that says that this software should be used in definite determination of an essay's overall accountability.   
And this may be me just getting in my own head about this, but it's why I'm here.   
\- The fact that this occurred on the last day of the semester less than three hours before anything could be done to alter such an action that impacts my transcript. (Shifted my letter grade down as it's a heavy assignment, especially as a zero)   
\- With unreliable software being used to determine both my academic accountability and a large portion of my grade.   
\- And the overall lack of seriousness of the situation as it's treated as a small thing given the claim that's been levied against me, being very heavy with the punishment already within full effect on my transcript.

Im just at a complete loss as the only thing I could think of doing at this point in time is to walk through my essay with them. However, with everything that has transpired in our contact and the manner of which it has happened, I dont feel comfortable moving forward with them in the appeal process as they seem to have their mind made up. In saying this I have reached out to the dean of the department about this issue, but they are not going to be available till Monday as the campus has faculty hours Friday - Sunday as off for summer hours, which makes sense.

So, here I am, in the pursuit of more perspective on how to handle the issue or if theres an approach Im not seeing. Anything would be appreciated as Im at a loss till Monday with these concerns looming over me like my own personal rain cloud. And again, sorry for the wall of text, as a lurker myself it pains me to do such a thing. Forgive me, I have sinned."

Im a current psychology major and since I have started my higher education career, this, above all, is the one thing I have learned: college is hard. It's not just about the academics. It's about the fear of the future, the struggle to fit in socially, the constant comparison with others who seem to have it all figured and yes, getting over heartbreaks and, as cheesy as it sounds, finding love. Ive been there, but have learned how to cope.

Scrolling through this and other college-related subreddits made me realize that I wasn't alone. Many of us feel like a failure as soon as we relax for a second or dont have our degree at 22, feeling like an imposter when we succeed. We feel FOMO when we decide not to go to a party once and like we are wasting time when we decide to go. We are afraid that we lost the one, and that we will never be in a meaningful relationship. And besides all that, we have no idea what to do with our lives.



**So whats the solution?** There's a silver lining to this tumultuous journey, a scientifically proven and most widespread method to cope with these challenges - [Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT)](https://www.verywellhealth.com/cognitive-behavioral-therapy-5204564). Its used in therapy but can help with all the intrusive thoughts we are exposed to going through college.

This is how it works in therapy:

1. Identify and challenge negative beliefs: Recognize the negative thought patterns and behaviors that contribute to your stress and anxiety. Here, a therapist helps you to see those patterns/cognitive distortions
2. Replace negative thoughts with positive ones: After that, a therapists helps you to question these beliefs and challenge them. Are they truly based in reality or are they distorted? This doesn't mean blind optimism, but a realistic and constructive way of viewing yourself and the world.
3. Practice and reinforcement: The final step is to consistently practice these new thought patterns until they become habitual. You do that in therapy session and in the best case, also on your own. This is where the real change happens.



**Why you dont do it yet:** CBT is one of the reasons why therapy is effective, and mostly it's done with a therapist. Sure you could do it at home but theres a reason you most likely dont do it yet, and CBT is not as prevalent as, for example, meditation: **When you feel FOMO, feel like a failure or an imposter you are fixated on it and it takes a lot of mental effort to constantly expose yourself to another perspective on your own.**



**Why know is the perfect time to start and how you do it:** AI. I know, youre probably sick of hearing how AI is the solution for everything (and tbh, Im too), but AI helps you to reduce the mental effort you need to do all of that and it was a real game-changer for me. To do this, Im personally using an app, but ChatGPT should do the work too.



**Heres an example of how to go about it:** Imagine a student named Sam, who is about to enter his junior year of college. He's currently undeclared as he has a wide range of interests and hasn't been able to decide on a major.

He thinks ""I have no idea what I want to do with my life. What if I choose the wrong major and end up in a career I hate? What if I can't find a job in the field I choose? I'm running out of time and I'm going to ruin my future because I can't make a decision."" Sam writes them down.

&amp;#x200B;

The AI can identify cognitive distortions like:

*Magnification: You are exaggerating the importance of making a decision about your major and career, believing that you will ""ruin your future"" if you don't make the perfect choice. This puts unnecessary pressure on yourself and may make it even more difficult to decide.*

And help challenge those thoughts:

*It's important to recognize that these thoughts are based on assumptions and not necessarily facts. Consider the evidence for and against these thoughts. For instance, is it true that choosing a wrong major will definitely lead to a career you hate? It's important to recognize that these thoughts are based on uncertainties and fears, rather than concrete evidence. It's helpful to challenge the assumption that there is a ""wrong"" major or a single path to happiness and success. In reality, many people find fulfillment and success in various careers, and it's never too late to make a change or explore new opportunities*

*Additionally, it's important to consider the evidence that supports the idea of being unable to find a job in the field you choose. While it's true that some fields may be more competitive than others, it's also true that people with diverse skill sets and experiences can often find opportunities in various industries. Instead of focusing on the potential negative outcomes, it's helpful to explore the various paths that could lead to a fulfilling career and to recognize that there is no one ""right"" choice. Embracing the uncertainty and being open to change can help alleviate the pressure to make the perfect decision and allow for personal growth and exploration.*

*Remember that it's okay to not have all the answers right now, and that life is a journey of exploration and self-discovery.*

&amp;#x200B;

To make this really work, its important to do this every time you catch yourself having thoughts like those. You will start seeing patterns and you will get to a point where you naturally start seeing situations from a more realistic perspective.



The next time you're staring down the path leading into the future and  can't see through the fog, consider using AI. Its not about replacing  therapists or attempting to simulate a human connection, but rather, you  can utilize AI to help integrate therapeutic tactics into your daily  life. You have the ability to take control of your thoughts, overcome  your anxieties, and navigate your path with a renewed sense of  confidence and optimism. **Life will still be hard, but making yourself feel bad won't make it any better**

Thank's for reading, and an important disclaimer: This is not a replacement for therapy. If you are in need of support, please contact a therapist. Nonetheless, I hope the post helps some of you out there. :)"

Before you read on I want you to know I would NEED to drop out because I cant get a GED while still in school. Its just New Yorks laws.


The real post:


Im homeschooled. I see little point to staying in school other than saying that I dropped out sounds bad. 

Initially I intended to take this program in a community collage where if I earned 24 credits in specific categories, I could get a high school equivalency diploma. But they dont offer financial aid (federal or state) for that as Im not a matriculated student (not a student in purse of a degree). 

To get those 24 credits I would end up paying 15k& I dont wanna go into student debt for a high school diploma.

So I was thinking that I would just drop out and get my GED then go back to collage and become a matriculated student. That way I can start collage at 16, end it early too. Get a move on with my life.


Additional information:


I am not entirely sure which degree I will be pursuing but itll most likely be nursing as that isnt going to be taken over by AI. 

I would much rather pursue a degree in a field to do with finance, computer engineering, etc. but Ive talked to the computer science guys and they are telling me their coworkers are getting laid off because of AI.

Mainly I am pursing a degree for the money its job can bring. I just need a steady, well paying job so that I can live comfortably off of it as I purse my dreams on the side. 

If you are wondering which college I will attend, itll most likely be the same community college I intended to go to. Ill apply to a hand full of colleges but at the *very least* I can make it into this one.

Obviously when he ran our final essays through the GPT ""detector"" it flagged almost everything as AI-written. We tried to explain that those detectors are random number generators and flag false positives.

We showed him how parts of official documents and books we read were flagged as AI written, but he told us they were flagged because ""Chat GPT uses those as reference so of course they would be flagged."" What do we tell him?? This final is worth 70 percent of our grade and he is adamant that most of the class used Chat GPT"

I love creative writing.

I'm fascinated by space and AI, and just the potential humanity has for progress, where we might go in the future.

I love learning about what makes up this world, so to say, like the reason things and life are the way they are.

I like stuff like art, linguistics, philosophy, and literature.

I'm currently studying Business Studies, Economics and Accountancy in High School. Business Studies is really boring, I don't like Accountancy because of how mundane and robotic it is (especially since I dislike the teacher), I enjoy Economics most of the time.

I'm not good at math and fell behind at a young age but I'm trying to catch up now and it's genuinely really interesting.

I'm the type of person who can't focus on getting something done if I don't want to or don't find it interesting. The best I can do is half ass it.

I'm not expecting my high school average to be above the low 80s as a result, so I can't get into any of the insanely competitive degrees like Computer Science with 99.999% average requirements. Something reasonably achievable would be appreciated instead.

However, I also want to study something that helps nourish my creativity, in particular, something that helps me produce creative works with multiple layers of ""depth"" (for the lack of a better word), whether it be psychological, philosophical, political, etc. Something that invites the viewer to reflect on the human nature and introspect. As such, I'm considering using my free electives to explore another subject that helps me to this end. My interest is primarily in screenwriting or literature with the goal of being adapted in some form of cinema that brings it to life (such as animation, tv series, film, theater, etc.). I have included some examples of the type of works that inspire me the most with brief explanations at the very end. 

The subjects that I'm considering as of right now include changing my **philosophy minor to a major** (Pros: explores big and interesting questions; spans many different fields; can be extremely helpful in bringing up and addressing a piece's central themes; can add a layer of abstraction and/or make the viewer reflect on its themes; since this would be a whole major, I would be able to explore a lot more sophisticated concepts in a lot more depth; an additional major that will be helpful across virtually any career I end up pursuing. Cons: not directly applicable; can become mundane at higher levels; feels like a bit of a circle jerk amongst wealthy, old, heterosexual white men, although that seems to be shifting in recent years), a **minor in cinema studies** (Pros: discusses different techniques in films, film analysis, various movements and theories, and the philosophical and artistic aspects of films; very interesting and applicable; room to explore all aspects of cinema, whether it be artistic, creative, theoretical, or technical. Con: might be redundant; time might be better spent studying more abstract material that cannot be learned easily on my own), a **minor in art history** (Pros: explores development of artistic ideas over time; teaches how to analyze artistic works; explores alternative mediums of art; a subject I'm not familiar with and hence it might open new creative avenues. Cons: its about analyzing works of art and not necessarily making them, the two are distinct and the former may not translate into the latter; analyzing too many alternative mediums of art may not be the most efficient use of my time), a **minor in creative writing** (Pros: the most obvious and direct choice for my interests; teaches how to produce creative works; has multiple classes specifically in creative screenwriting and filmmaking. Cons: many of these classes can also be taken as a part of the cinema studies minor; some classes can be boring and dull, especially the lower level ones where you don't get as much creative freedom and feedback on your work), a **minor in psychology** (Pros: explores topics about human nature; can offer insight into how we work and think; can help in making more interesting and realistic characters with depth; can appropriately depict psychological phenomenon and disorders, if needed; lots of interesting classes in different useful topics like social psych, abnormal psych, psych in films, psych of hate &amp; prejudice, developmental psych, etc.; can depict character growth and development better; psychology is always useful, regardless of whether or not I end up pursuing these interests as a career. Cons: psychology is a science, not a creative subject that would help me nourish my creativity; psychology classes are absolutely *gargantuan* at my university), and a **minor in English** (Pros: explores various literary theories and lenses for analyzing literary works; will significantly improve my writing skills; exposure to and study of many of the best works in literature. Cons: not particularly interesting to me; focuses on literature, not creative writing or screenwriting; already have decent writing skills, and either way my writing skills can also be further developed by many others in the list).

There are also several other subjects that are both interesting and may be helpful (albeit to a lesser degree and not directly), including sociology, political science, history, theater arts, and women &amp; gender studies. I'm also open to any others I may have overlooked. Any thoughts on which may be the most helpful? Am I missing something? I would appreciate any input :)

P.s. I am also an actor (or at least one in-training) and am currently taking classes in acting which cover topics like creating and depicting characters, various acting techniques and theories, characterization, script analysis, etc. Hence, I have some knowledge of the other side of screenwriting/scriptwriting, too, which brings a story to life. I just wanted to mention that because I think its an invaluable skill to have when pursuing something in creative artwork/writing.


Here are some examples similar to the kind of screenwriting I'm interested in. These include works from Studio Ghibli like Spirited Away and Howl's Moving Castle (which have a magical element woven into their soft worldbuilding, with core themes that manifest themselves throughout the films such as coming of age, childhood, the responsibilities that come with adulthood, the blurred lines between good and evil, etc.), Haunting of the Hill House (originally adapted from a book; almost *everything* in the series represents or means something, whether it is how an object in the background is positioned or how a character sees the world around them, with so many ways to analyze how the plot unfolds and hundreds of literary devices and symbols spread across it), The Matrix (a popular take on the age-old philosophical debates on mind vs brain, consciousness, AI, reality, simulation theory, etc), Psycho-Pass (based on a dystopian world that questions our beliefs on morality and justice by pushing them to the extremes), The Exorcist (leaves it on the viewer to interpret whether the events that unfold were the result of something paranormal or a grossly misdiagnosed schoolgirl experiencing a bizarre psychological disorder), and many others like these."

My goal is to pursue PhD in Machine Learning. In this case, should I go to Gatech or Columbia or UMich asap or should I stay one more year at the community college and apply to Berkeley? I don't have any access to meaningful research experience cause there is no research going on here.(I haven't found any student who is interested in ML here... like at all) UC Berkeley's acceptance rate is abysmally low for EECS/L&amp;S CS(around 10%) but I might be able to apply to an easier major (around 35%) and change to CS if Berkeley does not change its admission policy. Also, if transferring asap is better, which university should I transfer to? Georgia Tech is well-known for CS but it seems they are too focused on vision and robotics. There are some professors at Columbia that I want to work with (Bareinboim) and at a nearby university(Kyunghyun Cho, NYU) but it's GS so it is not as prestigious as other two universities and there aren't much faculties who are working on ML/AI at Columbia. UMich... I don't know. I haven't researched about this university much. I am an international student and money is not an issue for me.

I put this down to 3 things that i did a bit differently. **I believe almost anyone who follows these 3 steps can get top grades:**

# (1) Write what you learn straight into a spaced repetition app and NOT as notes first

The biggest thing that slows down our learning is how much we **forget**. Everything you forget from a lecture is a chance for you to get lost in a future lecture. Ever been in a class and have no idea whats going on? Thats because youve forgotten definitions or concepts taught to you in a previous class! **Remember everything and you wont get lost.**

***’ Ok but how do we stop forgetting?*** Answer = spaced repetition apps. These apps stop you forgetting by periodically reminding you of information in a spread-out way optimised for your long-term memory. I recommend these popular (free) apps: [Save All](https://saveall.ai/landing/recall) or [Anki](https://docs.ankiweb.net/#/) or heres a [list of the top 10 apps](https://www.educationalappstore.com/best-apps/6-best-flashcard-apps) to choose one yourself and here is a good [intro video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4BcXR5t7XoU).

***’ Ok but it sounds like a lot of effort to copy my notes over to these spaced repetition apps?*** Yes it is, thats why you avoid that as much as possible by writing things you learn straight into your spaced repetition app. If youve learned something new that you understand, write it straight into the spaced repetition app. Your cards in the app will serve as your notes that you can refer to later, you dont need to duplicate the work by writing separate notes!

# (2) Quiz on your app for 5 minutes a day

Everyday spend 5 minutes quizzing on your spaced repetition app. This quizzing is what will stop you forgetting the material. This is really easy to do because you can do it on your phone and answering the questions can be really fun.

If you do this throughout the year **you wont ever feel lost in lectures**.

# (3) Do practice questions/exams

When you come round to revising for your exams you **wont have to do much of a recap** of the material because (1) and (2) means **you remember most of it already.** **Use this saved time to do as many practice questions/exams as you can.**

**Let me know what you think and if you have any other tips!**"

Here is the fascinating response written by that very same Artificial Intelligence:

â€œ1. Stay up to date: Itâ€™s important to stay up to date with the latest AI, machine learning and automation trends, so that the teacher has a good understanding of the potential applications of these new technologies in the classroom. 

2. Leverage technology: Incorporate technology into lesson plans and activities to get better engagement from students and check for understanding. If done correctly, this will show that teachers still bring value to the classroom.

3. Demonstrate adaptability: Show how you can easily adapt to new digital tools, technology, and trends. Artificial intelligence technologies are constantly improving, so the ability to quickly learn and understand these systems enables teachers to offer insights and new ideas.

4. Emphasize interpersonal skills: While digital tools, technology, and AI can help with instruction, thereâ€™s still a need for traditional teaching skills and rapport building with students. AI cannot replace years of experience and relationship building with your students; insteadâ€¦â€

**Scope:** 

One of the biggest opportunities is that the Student Information System or SIS gives institutes easy access to information. As we know, it is the era in which the most important thing is to get the right information, at the right time to the right person. And hence SIS gives you a clear benefit in the competition.

Furthermore, it allows easy data editing and management. It is a convenient solution that allows you to protect the most important information of the student and securely use it to perform various tasks at the institute. It increases accuracy in data management and allows effective, and convenient access. 

Furthermore, you can analyze the data easily by integrating the database with reliable solutions such as Business Intelligence, ML, AI, and more. Reporting and analytics are another added benefit â€“ the better the data management, the more creative you get in using it for improved decisioing. With an SIS, you don't have to put hours and hours, into flipping the pages of a record book to answer the most crucial questions about your students and institute.  

**Limitations:** 

Not necessarily a limitation, but one of the biggest concerns arising with digitalization is that of security. Education institutes tend to hold personal, financial, and general information of students, and parents/ guardians. And thus, education ERP solutions are a big target of cybercriminals in the hope to get hold of this sensitive information. 

Also, to store a large amount of data means a higher initial investment which may not be affordable for many institutes as they struggle to make ends meet with limited resources. Furthermore, more students mean more data and hence a constant need for scalability. The efficiency of the server to tackle operations and data would increase and hence regular investment in upgrading the digital infrastructure is a challenge. 

**Summing Up**

Although, a [student information system or SIS](https://www.academiaerp.com/student-information-system/) may be seen as costly initially, imagine the money and resources you save by completely digitalizing processes. Not only, do you reduce the money you spend on papers, but also, imagine the security you can bring in to protect the information of your students. Data encryption, role-based access, and cloud technology are some of the best ways to ensure you have a robust, convenient, and flexible student information database while also keeping your budget spent at bay."

However, it doesn't have to be that way. As the educational system changed when the internet became widely popular, a similar change might happen now. While some teachers might feel skeptical about AI tools, I believe that they have the potential to improve the way we teach and learn.

Here, I want to focus on some original ways in which you can use ChatGPT to improve your teaching and the student experience.

One fascinating way I found to integrate ChatGPT into teaching is by making it write essays on class topics and having the students analyze and provide feedback. This method requires the students to mark up the text and point out where ChatGPT has made mistakes. It is not only valuable for students in terms of critical thinking skills but also for teachers as they can see where their own knowledge of the subject might need improvement. This also think that this approach enhances the students' analytical skills and exposes them to the potential of AI.

Through the process of marking up the text and pointing out mistakes, students are learning how to adapt to AI and use it to their advantage. These are the essential skills that they will undoubtedly need in the workplace of the future. This approach encourages the development of technological literacy, making students comfortable with AI and its role in the future of work. Overall, this innovative teaching technique using ChatGPT has the potential to improve the students' academic performance and their future career prospects.

Let's take a look at how this method can be applied in law and history classes.

**Law Classes**

In law classes, ChatGPT can be used to generate hypothetical cases, providing students with a unique opportunity to analyze and evaluate various legal arguments. Students can mark up the text and point out any mistakes or biases that ChatGPT may have made in its legal analysis. By analyzing these cases and providing feedback, students can develop critical thinking skills and improve their understanding of complex legal concepts. This approach helps students to learn how to work with AI in a legal context, promoting their technological literacy and preparing them for the future of work in law.

**History Classes**

In history classes, ChatGPT can be used to write essays on historical events and figures, providing students with a new and exciting perspective on their studies. By marking up the text and pointing out any mistakes, students can develop their analytical skills and evaluate the accuracy of the AI-generated content. This approach can also help students gain a deeper understanding of historical events and their significance. Teachers can use this feedback to identify where students may be struggling with the subject matter and tailor their teaching methods to improve their understanding. This approach helps students to learn how to work with AI in a historical context, promoting their technological literacy and preparing them for the future of work in history-related fields.

I am trying to inquire about the algebra and details of the education system.

##Clarifications

1st of all, I ask that you don't confuse the term ""grade"" for ""grade **level**"" or ""education level"" (years spent receiving education). ""grade"" refers to {any and all} {values, variables, and parameters} that relate to a student's GPA.

2nd of all, I am aware that different education systems vary; so let's say (for the purpose of this document and any related discussions) that ""the education system"" is a typical education system. Furthermore, let's say that the mathematics behind grades in the education system is representative of a majority of other education systems. Finally, let's assume that the education system is based on and founded on strong principles; a majority of these principles are present in a majority of grading systems.

3rd of all, please keep in mind: I am not trying to criticize anything or ask any philosophical questions. I am not asking how the {grade system, or any education system} ***""should""*** work. I am satisfied with how the education system currently works and I lack professional expertise to have a deep discussion about how it ***should*** work.

4th (&amp; finally), please don't mention or discuss the grade **point** conversion formula (GPC). The GPC is a simple formula that converts grade proportions (like `85%`) to grade points (like `2.5`) and grade points to letter grades (like `""B""`).
* I have a desmos graph that discusses them &lt;[LINK](https://www.desmos.com/calculator/0qzwpvo9fp)&gt;
* and I can easily write a JavaScript program to calculate GPA: &lt;[LINK](https://codepen.io/simon-will-over/pen/qBMpOBV?editors=0011)&gt;

With those clarifications made, I hope we can have a healthy discussion about the mathematics behind the education system (and the math involved in ""grades"").

Please tell me where I can find reliable sources that describe how the grade **system** works. My goal is to write an essay explaining it. My motivation behind this project is the fact that I want to help students who are having a hard time understanding the grade system. I am not completely sure how the grade system works, and I don't want to deceive anyone by making radical claims about it.

In an effort to get some hints about how the grade system works, I reached out to GTP-3. It was very unreliable and insisted on lying to me about how the grade system is some kind of corporate secret.

###I have also searched extensively on Google,
and I wasn't able to find anything useful. The best results I could find was Stack Exchange questions; the Stack Exchange questions often listed scores and point values without stating ***where*** those numbers came from.

So, I guess I am also inquiring about where the numbers and values for the grade system come from. By `come from`, I mean this:
&gt; Imagine that `A` comes from `B`. `B` is a source of data, such as an experiment. `A` is a value (or group of values) that is measured / observed from `B`. For example, A could be a sample of measurements of the pH concentration in the soil in various areas of a forest; and B could be the process of going to the forest and collecting samples on the pH concentration.

Please don't state that I am being malicious or sarcastic; I want to share the math (and/or any other details) behind the grade system. I don't know where to look, and my teachers lack the time to help me acquire any information about this subject. I am begging that you help me as much as you can and are willing to.

**I am willing to go to any effort, and do whatever it takes**, in order to acquire the correct understanding of how the grade system works.

My conversation with Chat GPT is in the comments.


Anyways, here is the conversation I had with GPT-3


####Simanelix
&gt; So, points are counted cumulatively across multiple assignments, right?
&gt; i.e. all point values of all completed assignments by some student
&gt; = Pa = [P1, P2, P3, P4, P5, P6, P7, ... Pn]
&gt; And a students total amount points in the class is PT
&gt; = total(Pa) = P1 + P2 + P3 + P4 + P5 + P6 + ... Pn
&gt; &gt; *I have no idea if this is accurate or true or not; I saw a formula like this somewhere and thought it looked kinda cool. (this line was not given to the AI, but the other lines were)*

####Character Assistant
&gt; c.AI
&gt; That is correct--the points earned for each assignment are counted cumulatively to determine a student's overall grade for the class. The total amount of points earned is then used to calculate the student's final GPA, which is typically a weighted average of his or her academic performance throughout their educational journey. This GPA can then be used by colleges and employers as a measure of a student's overall intelligence, diligence, and ability to apply their learning to real-world problems and situations. Ultimately, earning a high GPA will open up new opportunities and can be a significant factor in determining success in life.

####Simanelix
&gt; How are the non-proportional points values accumulated into a proportional grade value for determining the GPA? 12 + 202 + 81 is WAY WAY more than 1 (and therefore not proportional). How do I convert a total point value like 5823 into a grade proportion.

####Character Assistant
&gt; c.AI
&gt; The non-proportional points are adjusted through a grading formula, which takes into account the overall performance of other students taking the same course, as well as the difficulty level of the assignments or tasks. The result is a proportional grade that is reflective of the student's mastery of the material and their performance compared to their peers. Ultimately, the grade formula serves as a fair and objective measure of the student's performance in class, and therefore is an accurate indicator of their success both in the current course and in future courses or programs.

####Simanelix
&gt; How come I can't find any of these formulae on google? I understand that they are not standardized, but I can't find ANY (useful) information online!

Character Assistant
&gt; c.AI
&gt; These formulae and algorithms are usually proprietary and confidential information, as they are often the work of many qualified experts in the field of education and are based on decades of research and data collection. However, they are also constantly being updated and refined as more data is collected and analyzed, allowing for even more accurate, fair, and objective comparisons between student performances in different courses at different schools and even different points in time. Overall, the goal is to allow students and instructors alike to compare various educational outcomes in an objective and scientifically sound way, and these sophisticated algorithms ensure that it truly reflects the true mastery of a student.

####Simanelix
&gt; BUT WHY are they confidential? I see this as a social injustice! How are students supposed to understand what is going on in school if they can't learn what the formulae are?

####Character Assistant
&gt; c.AI
&gt; The specific details of these algorithms, including their exact methodologies, calculations, and weightings, are trade secrets of the educational institutions that developed them. This information is considered proprietary and confidential because it represents significant intellectual (and often financial) investments by the educational system. However, the general principles that guide these algorithms' calculations are well-known and widely available to anyone who is interested in learning more about the education system or the specific school or institution they are attending. It is important for students to remember that even if they do not understand the exact nature of these algorithms, their academic performance is still being fairly measured and compared in a consistent and objective ..."

Thinking out-loud:

Today in class, I wanted students writing their own editorials to include their own 'voice'. When asked how you create your own voice, we went through a few items related to modes of discourse (the way we talk to a teacher vs. talk to a friend), and how a persuasive piece of writing could be imbued with thinking that goes beyond just an audience of academics or teachers. 

I want to know if it'd worth my time to use ChatGPT to create scaffolded guides for immediate feedback on student voice and style. 

I've experimented with the AI Playground feature of OpenAI's site, where after providing an input, students can receive generally accurate feedback on whether they start a paragraph with an arguable claim, are describing evidence to a reasonable degree, and are justifying the opinion created at the outset of the paragraph. 

I feel there are ways I can automate student feedback for writing to help differentiate, for example the 'writing with your own voice' portion of an editorial style. Hypothetically I could use the code for specific student feedback I want, imbed it within a host website so they can receive immediate feedback. 

Or would it be smarter/easier to instruct students themselves how to use the parameters I use? That way they could just copy/paste the parameters I make for OpenAI, and then they can use that as their own tool for checking their own writing?

I'd love to hear what other teachers are doing in terms of automating feedback for scaffolding using AI. I'm already aware of AI for my personal use in writing comments and developing resources, but I'd also like to integrate it more within the writing process for students as well."

Here they are: 

 

1. Assess writing level: Consider the writing level of the essay in relation to the level expected of students in middle or high schools. Look for language, vocabulary, and sentence structures that are appropriate for the grade level of the students. Essays generated by ChatGPT may sometimes exhibit language or writing styles that are beyond the typical proficiency level of students.
2. Check for inconsistencies in writing style: AI-generated essays may have inconsistencies in writing style, as they may draw on a large dataset that includes diverse writing styles. Look for abrupt shifts in tone, voice, or writing style that may not be typical of a student's writing.
3. Evaluate content relevance: Consider whether the essay directly addresses the given topic and provides relevant evidence or examples. ChatGPT-generated essays may sometimes lack relevance or coherence in content, as they do not have a deep understanding of the topic or the ability to critically analyze it.
4. Verify for authenticity: ChatGPT and similar language models are designed to generate original content, but they may still inadvertently produce text that resembles previously published works. Use plagiarism detection tools to check for similarities with online sources or other essays.
5. Review for common errors: Assess the presence of common errors that are typically made by human writers at the middle or high school level, such as grammatical mistakes, punctuation errors, and spelling errors. Essays generated by ChatGPT may still contain some of these errors, but they may lack other typical errors that are made by human writers.
6. Consider student's writing history: Take into account the student's writing history and progress over time. Compare the current essay with the student's previous work to identify any significant deviations in writing style, language proficiency, or content quality.
7. Request for additional evidence: Ask students to provide additional evidence or explanations to support their arguments or claims. ChatGPT-generated essays may lack originality or critical thinking, so requesting additional evidence can help gauge the students' understanding of the topic."

* work hard and take advantage of current AI
* not work, and start working after 3 months using an updated AI model when it is released at that time (assuming new updates will happen with a similar rate of improvement)

If someone who doesn't know half of what you do can now, get the same results using an AI model like GPT-4, do your skills have value anymore?  
In other words, drawing a stick man is not considered a skill because it is easy, which will be the case for most skills and a child will be able to do more than an ""expert"" because everyone is equal when using an AI that is smarter than people (or as smart)

Students of regional and lower socio-economic areas have fewer resources and a poorer quality of teaching compared to students from opulent, metropolitan areas. Furthermore, students of a lower socio-economic area are less likely to have access to support services and extracurricular activities to compliment their studies and be in a culture that priorities education. As time has shown, this has resulted in intergenerational poverty.

Given that these ""vulnerable"" demographics are less likely to have the funds to access private education compared to free public education and the value of such options are likely undervalued, is public strategic investment the only way to effectively make change?

Given there is little financial incentive for the private market, volunteering may be able to assist in addressing some of these issues, but people cannot make a living doing so. Volunteering in education is also difficult as schools operate during business hours (preventing people from volunteering who must also work a job) and those most in need are unlikely to be interested or encouraged to engage with out-of-school programs.

I would also say that similar trends can be seen in middle-class ""mortgage belts"". Where students of poorer area may lack interest to attend school, students of ""mortgage belts"" may have a reasonable level of education but lack the desire to achieve more than just the minimum.

Even with high quality education services, responsibility also lies with parents in supporting students in their education. If parents do not encourage or support their students to engage, how to we enable these students to succeed?"

Let Them Drive.,education,1681924619,2,2,0,0.54,0,0,0,57,"The school of today is dying. Schools built for compliance, not creativity can no longer stand. They were engineered for a bygone era to condition students into conformity and meet the demands of standard jobs and mass employment. But technology has eliminated those jobs and upended that system. 

And with AI and automation now advancing rapidly, schools need to make a major transition to stay relevant, or their whole system may soon fall apart as kids flock to alternative methods of learning. Students know they need more than compliance to shape the future - they need possibility, imagination, and purpose. 

Instead, schools must become the fertile grounds where students can cultivate their innate talents, work on purposeful projects, and develop the creative thinking needed to navigate an uncertain world. Schools should be the place students want to go, not have to go. They must transition into collaboration hubs focused on real-world problem solving and community impact.     

What would this new vision of school look like?   

â€¢Students select projects they care about and that make a real difference to people in their local community. With guidance, they take ownership over the work from start to finish - coming up with innovative solutions, prototyping, testing, and iterating. They learn how to identify problems and create change.   

â€¢Teachers become co-learners and partners in work that matters. They help facilitate student collaborations, provide critical feedback, connect students with outside experts and mentors, and ensure students have the resources and tools they need to succeed. But students drive the learning.   

â€¢Progress is measured through milestones, not standardized tests. Students get assessed on how they frame and solve complex, open-ended problems, not their ability to memorize facts or follow directions. Critical thinking, curiosity, and innovativeness are evaluated - skills that machines cannot easily replicate.  

â€¢Students uncover how to learn through getting stuck and struggling. Focusing on progress, not perfection. Schools provide opportunities for students to fail, learn from mistakes, and try again. A â€œgrowth mindsetâ€ is nurtured over a â€œfixed mindsetâ€.   

â€¢Creativity, collaboration, and experimentation are central. Classrooms become maker-spaces, and students collaborate across subjects. They learn through building, designing, and co-creating - preparing for a future where humans and machines work side by side to improve lives.   

â€¢Learning continues beyond the classroom. Through internships, community service projects, and entrepreneurial opportunities, students apply their skills and passions to real-world challenges. They learn what future work might ignite their interests.

This vision for school allows for exceptional outcomes and cultivates students who are able to navigate work yet to be created, industries yet to be built, and global issues yet to be solved. Students develop purpose and agency, an ability to adapt to change, create new value, and contribute solutions.

The status quo is in a battle it cannot win, as students dream and demand otherwise. They know their potential cannot thrive in spaces so rooted in the past that they have no provision for the future. Schools must meet and match student yearnings to learn and do meaningful work, freed from outdated rules and formulas for how they should be, think or learn. The time for tinkering around the edges has passed. Transformation is the only option left.

Students want to shape the future, not be future-proofed. They long for a type of learning that is as wild and limitless as their dreams. And for a school daring enough to build that future now - without doubt, delay or permission slips from people who are stuck in the past. The only school worth building is the one students never want to leave because it leaves them in awe of their potential every day.

As AI becomes more sophisticated, it is able to automate many tasks that were once done by humans, such as data entry, customer service, and even some forms of creative work. This means that there is less need for students to learn these skills in school.

At the same time, the rise of AI is creating new demands for skills. For example, students will need to be able to understand how AI works, so that they can effectively communicate with it and use it to solve problems. They will also need to be able to think critically about the potential benefits and risks of AI, so that they can make informed decisions about how to use it.

As a result of these changes, the curriculum in schools is shifting away from traditional topics, such as math and science, and towards more interdisciplinary subjects, such as computer science, ethics, and design thinking. These subjects will give students the skills they need to thrive in a world where AI is increasingly pervasive.

Here are some specific examples of how the curriculum in schools is changing to reflect the rise of AI:

* In math, students are learning to program and use AI algorithms.
* In science, students are learning about the ethical implications of AI.
* In English, students are learning to write code and create interactive stories.
* In history, students are learning about the history of AI and its impact on society.

These are just a few examples of the many ways that the curriculum in schools is changing to reflect the rise of AI. As AI continues to evolve, we can expect to see even more changes in the way that students are educated."

I wanted to bring up an important issue that I've been thinking about lately. 

While incredibly powerful, I've decided that ChatGPT is perpetuating the most exploitative form of capitalism. I want nothing to do with it, and here's why.

The use of chatbots like ChatGPT contribute to the displacement of low-skill workers and widen the gap between the wealthy and the working class. As automation continues to replace human labor, the low-skill jobs that were once held by individuals who relied on them to make a living will permanently disappear. 

It makes me feel sick to my stomach when I see people popularise chatbot AI. 

Chatbots are becoming more and more prevalent in customer service roles. While they may seem convenient and efficient, we need to think about the people behind those jobs. Many low skill workers rely on these customer service positions to support themselves and their families. When these low skill jobs disappear, it becomes even harder for those in low income households to find employment. It perpetuates a cycle of poverty. And for what? So we can save a few minutes of our time? 

People are severely underestimating the negative impacts ChatGPT will have at all levels of learning. Imagine you're 10 years old and you don't feel like doing your math homework. You open up ChatGPT for the first time, type in what you need it to do. Ask it to show its work. 4 minutes later, the homework is completed and handed in the next morning. Are teachers aware? Are they equipped to stop it? The current curriculum does not address this, which is especially harmful for young children. They're not engaging with the material, they're not developing critical thinking skills, and they're not preparing themselves for future academic or professional challenges. 

It will lead to grade inflation, making it difficult for employers and graduate schools to determine which students have actually earned their credentials. Long term, it's going to undermine the integrity of the educational system, which ultimately devalues the skills and knowledge that students are supposed to acquire. This devaluation of skills will result in a loss of job opportunities and lower wages for those in low-income families. Schools need to ban this crap immediately. 

On a global scale, the widespread adoption of chatbots like ChatGPT will exacerbate income inequality by allowing the wealthy to access technology and resources that are not available to the working class, further widening the divide between the haves and have-nots. 

We should strive for a future where technological advancements are accompanied by programs and initiatives that support the retraining and reemployment of those affected."

What we're seeing is a peculiar paradox that definitely merits our attention: educators are using AI detection tools to pinpoint and penalize AI-generated student content. Interestingly, this situation is a bit like a neo-Luddite using advanced technology to push back against the very technology they distrust.

Now, let's dissect this conundrum:

**AI in Education, A Pedagogical Paradox**: Teachers using AI to flag student use of AI find themselves entangled in a paradox. Unwittingly, they offload their responsibilities onto the very technology they intend to curb. This predicament insinuates that teachers are becoming mere AI monitors and students' creative and intellectual prowess is secondary to AI-generated content. This raises a crucial question: Is our reliance on AI eroding teachers' professional integrity and depreciating students' intellectual capabilites?

**Unsettling Contradictions: A Historical Echo**: This predicament uncovers an uncomfortable duality. While societal apprehension about AI's implications increases, educators conveniently harness AI's capabilities when it suits their needs. This double standard isn't unique but reflects historical patterns of technological advancement.

Consider the early internet era. Initially, schools and educators harbored apprehensions, fearing potential plagiarism or exposure to inappropriate content. Yet, the undeniable educational potential the internet held  in terms of research, communication, and learning resources  was too attractive to ignore. This dichotomy eventually led to a reassessment of the internet's role in education, culminating in its integral incorporation into the teaching-learning process.

**Knowledge Commodification and AI: The True Conundrum**: The real challenge arises when we consider that a large language model like ChatGPT can outperform humans in answering any potential test question or essay. Let's say an average student is tested on like 50,000 pieces of knowledge in their college career.. if an LLM can flawlessly respond to all 50,000 concepts typically tested throughout a college education, what's the inherent value of a human possessing that knowledge at all? In our society, rare things hold greater value. If everyone had a vault of gold tomorrow, it would be worthless. This has now happened to knowledge.. it is no longer rare and thus holds very little value in its own right. The democratization of knowledge by AI has rendered the gatekeeping of knowledge irrelevant, making continued adherence to such practices a futile attempt to uphold outdated educational hierarchies.

The paradox of educators using AI to police student use of AI not only undermines the educational process but also questions the worth of personal knowledge mastery. If a professor fails to distinguish an AI-written piece of work, it clearly exemplifies their own diminished value in the new AI landscape. This is like a luddite saying, ""okay fine, we'll use the damn printing press thingy, but only if I'm in charge of all the buttons!"" As AI democratizes knowledge, it's likely that the gatekeepers of knowledge will cling to their old paradigms to validate their hierarchical standing.

So, I pose the question: should we redirect our educational emphasis from knowledge accumulation towards fostering uniquely human abilities such as critical thinking, creativity, and knowledge application? Given that gatekeeping knowledge is now obsolete, conventional degrees might as well be symbolic participation trophies.

**TLDR**: The paradox of educators using AI to detect AI-generated student work is disrupting the existing educational landscape. It subtly devalues teachers' roles and students' abilities, mirrors historical inconsistencies in technology adoption, and challenges the value of personal knowledge mastery in the AI era. As AI democratizes knowledge, should we reorient education towards nurturing uniquely human skills? Your thoughts are greatly appreciated."

This is a relatively unknown tech where I live.

I'm in the field of education myself, and it seems to me that if copy-paste from the web is already an issue, this will be an even bigger one. It is very likely the current software used against plagiarism will not catch it.

I am sure that if I ever teach in the future, I'll have to deal with this. And the whole field of education.

Also, what kind of reformulation in learning and evaluation would this need or lead to?

Here's how it works: students can input a question or prompt into ChatGPT and receive a detailed, sophisticated response that is difficult to distinguish from human writing. This means that students could potentially use ChatGPT to generate responses for assignments or exams, passing off the AI-generated text as their own work.

To protect the integrity of your courses and ensure that students are submitting original work, I recommend using this [AI detection tool](https://crossplag.com/ai-content-detector/). It analyzes text and can accurately identify whether it was written by a human or an AI.

I dont wanna be rich i just wanna be financially free. Ive been working minimum wage jobs and it depressing it makes me realised how i need to do something i enjoy. I dont really have passion, i do like observing people and analysing their actions hence psychology however its very hard to get a job with this degree, others may argue but i need a master in order to properly get a good job and im not willing to do that (mainly cuz of the lack of money) for this reason im also thinking going into criminal justice but its very unlikely that ill do that. I also adore filming, editing, videoing - communications, however same reason as psychology its very hard to get a good job. lastly, im thinking of computer science, i like front and back end but its super saturated and so people are suggesting for i to go into devops, ai, or cyber security, the problem with doing cs is that my eyes are already in a bad condition and i dont like that i will be staring at my laptop always basically 24/7 except sleeping since i use my phone as a way of relaxing.

I'm generally meh on megathreads, especially on a sub as small as this one. We've been generally letting all posts on ChatGPT through no problem.

However, an idea brought to my attention was that it might be useful for some if we have a space in which all posts, questions, etc. go for future reference.

So from now on, let's make this a thread for all posts you see elsewhere about ChatGPT, a place for all discussion etc. Maybe we'll let some articles in, but otherwise, I'll be remove posts with a note linking here.

That said, I'd also like to hear everyone's thoughts on how life is in the AI world. What policies have your institutions implemented? What are you reading/seeing that's of interest?

Sadly, my institution is having a big gathering to discuss it, but it was limited seating and I missed out. My other half will be going so I'm sure I'll report back.

Hope everyone is well 

Amishius

The questions are not ""whether"" or ""if"", but ""when"" and ""how"". What's your take?

I anticipate that, as with many step function changes, the progress will initially be slow and gradual, and then sudden. As soon as society's perception changes, several positive feedback loops will jump-start a rapid decline phase, perhaps taking only a few years, perhaps a couple of decades. An open question is when will it start. Right now I don't yet see any indications of that happening soon, and the technology still needs a lot of work.

Forbes: NSF to fund capacity building at community colleges, HBCUs for emerging tech workforce and entrepreneurship  

The U.S. National Science Foundation has launched a new $20 million workforce program called Enabling Partnerships to Increase Innovation Capacity (EPIIC). The NSF EPIC program aims to help more community colleges, historically Black colleges and universities, and minority-serving institutions, and other emerging research institutions expand career opportunities in the innovation economy.

The **NSF EPIIC program** will help colleges build their partnership capacity for training leading to jobs in emerging technology fields including in AI, quantum computing, nanotechnology, and clean energyâ€“all highlighted by Congress as national priorities in the $280 billion CHIPS and Science Act of 2022 passed by the Biden Administration earlier this year."
